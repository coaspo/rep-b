Fast Food Nation The Dark side of the All-American Meal by Eric Schlosser  ðŸ—“ 2001
historian/Princeton, journalist, father was president of NBC

INTRODUCTION____________________________________________________________________

Cheyenne Mountain Air Force Command:
  4.5 acres, miles of tunnels, 15 buildings 3 stories - on springs to ride out
  blast or earth quake, 3 ft thick/25 ton doors, pressurized air
  (to prevent radioactive contamination), 1,500 people work, get McDonald's
  Domino's fast food deliveries

What we eat
  2000: spent more money on fast food than on higher education.
  Roman republic fed by citizen farmers, Roman empire fed by its slaves
  Adjusted for inflation hourly wage peaked at 1973.
  1975 1/3 women worked, 2000 2/3
  1/2 money for food is spent mostly in fast food
  McDonald's: More money from rent than restaurants.
              Centralize purchase decisions and standardize products  -->
              mimicked by other industries ---> wipe out: small business,
              eliminate regional differences, "self-replicating"
  1/9 dead Americans get services from Service Cor. International mortuary
  Go from cradle to grave without an independently owned business.
  Uniformity --> franchise success
  Ray Kroc one of the founders of McDonald's: "Organization cannot trust
                            individual, Individual must trust the organization".
  Industry dedicated to conformity found by non-conformists; only few chain
  moguls went to college.
  Capitalism best/worst: innovations, new products/unskilled workers:
    no benefits, learn no skills, no control of work, quit in few months.
  Restaurants: largest employer & lowest wages - migrants are lower
  Technology glorification "Better living thru chemistry" ,"our friend the atom"
  West demand for low taxes, small government, free market, has gotten most
    federal subsidies.
  Fast food industry: since Nixon oppose food/worker safety & minimum wage
    Large commodity companies; eliminate family farms; rural ghettos.
    Jefferson's  independent farmers vanished.
    More prison inmates than farmers.
    Vast purchase power & uniformity demand:
      meat-packers: highly skilled/paid --> dangerous/low wage jobs
    Escherichia coli O157:H7 in hamburgers
    Government can recall toasters but not contaminated meat
    Catalyst and symptom of economic trends
    Feeds and feeds off the young
    Narrow measure of efficiency: "the irrationality of rationality"

3. BEHIND THE COUNTER___________________________________________________________
________________________________________________________________________________
Colorado Springs: Golf Rush town; urban sprawl: nearly identical houses
    every few miles cluster of typical fast food joints

  Space mountain
    Colorado Springs: 1/3 lived 5 year or less, most came from California
      covers more land than Denver which has 4x population
      1951 Air force command
      Space command "in your face from outer space"
      Chamber of Commerce: union membership stands at 0.0%
      Nicknames: "space mountain", "silicon mountain", "free world space capital"
      Evangelical, ultra conservative: no single public official registered democrat
    1972 in southwest democrats ruled - now republicans
    1990'as 1 million left California - "the new white flight" to Colorado
      California switched from republican to democrat
    Colorado education budget ranked 49th
      Biggest employer is restaurants
    Play "Follow the leader": McDonald's opens other follow
      >70% visits are impulsive -> location is critical;
         McDonald used planes, helicopters, satellite, quantillion software
         "spy on customers with tech used to fight cold war"
         Colorado Springs was a test site.
         Software predicts  future orders based on customer flow, assign tasks...
           "just in time" production philosophy of Japanese auto

  Throughput
    16-year old: gets up 5:15, starts work 7:00, 7 hours cash register,feet hurt
    2/3 of food chain workers under 20; part time, low skill, low wages
    Labor like in auto industry not important
      Throughput (speed,volume flows) is most important
    Burger king conveyor belt -> 90sec burger
    Taco bell's dehydrated beans - "just add water"
    MacDonald's operation manual "the bible" 700 pages; fries .28 in thick,
      "smile with a greeting and make a positive first contact"
      "show them you are GLAD to see them, include eye contact.."
    Exactness of tasks make workers interchangeable
      not enough teen workers --> immigrants, elderly, handicapped
      ~10% speak no English, learn how to get on work on time

  Stroking
    1999 conference on labor shortage:
      make equipment intuitive - easier to do right thing instead wrong
      allow only one process; zero training worthy goal
    Get federal subsidies for employ training ($2,400/employee)
      & do research to eliminate it.
    $384 million to create low-pay, low skill, short term jobs for poor;
      lobbyist: "The have to crawl before they can walk"
    1/3.5 million migrant/fast-food employee
      300 to 400% turn over rate - quit or fired every 3 to 4 months
    1968 -> 1990 real value of minimum wage dropped 40%
    Restaurants supported eliminating minimum wage; proposed guest workers
    Fair Labor Act 1938: minimum wage, no child labor, 1.5x for overtime.
    90% fast food workers: no benefits, work on demand, 30 hrs/week
      managers: medical benefits, bonus/profit sharing, long hours no overtime.
    Manger training: "transaction analysis" from 1969 book "I'm OK you're OK":
      stroking technique: positive reinforcement, deliberate praise, recognition
                          that teenagers do not get at home.
    Creative management: have workers wait until it got busy, clean/work after
      end of shift & reward with food.
      Taco Bell paid millions and admitted no wrong doing

  Detecting lies
    Sociologist, fast food worker for a year: most valued trait: worker obedience.
    On union attempts, "flying squad" of managers/executives held "informal rap"
      session to let workers express their feelings.
    San Francisco MacDonald's gave workers lie detector tests, force to remove
      illegal "right to give lie test" from job application.
    Union attempt in Canada: 15 lawyers hired, delay hearing for a year, closed
      right before certification: "Cannot have MacJob with MacUnion"

  Protecting youth
    White upper middle class teens: lifeguards, golf, mall... social status
    Poor teens: mostly fast food (bottom of the heap)
                both parents work, rely on school for discipline...
                work to have a car
                  less time for homework & after school activities
                at 16 can stop school & work
                at Colorado Springs 1/2 graduate high school
                apathy & depression
                some dreamed of working at McDonald's since they were toddlers
    "Protecting Youth at work" report: teen work reduces their educational &
       financial success. Some work improves their self-esteem.
    Customers look down on fast food-workers - throw hamburgers at them..
    To fast-food teens telemarketing looks better (more controlled workspace):
      $10 to $15/hour, 15 presentation per hour, 9 out of 10 people refuse.
    Fair Labor Standards Acts: 16 years cannot work more than 3 hours/school-day
      is often violated: teens works 12 hour shifts, stay until 2 AM
    Most kids liked working at fast food - in kitchen fooling with their friends.
    Manager personality --> whether workplace is fun.

  Inside jobs
    Injuries (slip/fall/strains/burns) of teens is twice the rate as adults.
    4-5 killed per month during a robbery (fast food has mostly cash payments)
    1998 more restaurant workers killed than police.
    2/3 or fast food robberies are by current or former employees
      no other industry is robbed so much by own employees
    1/2 workers in involved in job theft  ~ $218 average /worker/year
      Treatment by dignity & respect reduces it: common sense, not common practice
      Anger --> theft --> robbery
      McDonald's manager recognized that robber was the night manager.
    To reduce violence, OSHA recommend more lights at parking lots.
      Restaurant Association opposed it.
    OSHA severe critic: republican congressman who at one time had 2 taco bells.
      Lobby group against OSHA: "Alliance for Workspace Safety"
    Fast-food cook became serial killer killing other fast-food workers.
    FBI & industry do not keep statistics...

  Making it fun
    Keynote speech at a fast-food conference: recognize workers by pep talks.
       awards (rubber chili peppers, chickens..).
       "Be great company for people who make it great"
    Other speakers: teamwork, worker empowerment, making it "fun".
    "push for minimum wage increase - ... fun - I love it - strike me dead"

4. SUCCESS______________________________________________________________________
________________________________________________________________________________
  Pueblo "the asshole of Colorado" - opposite to Colorado Springs.
  Economic revival withe fast food chains, home depot...

  Devotion to a new faith
    Franchisor: expand company without spending money
                provide brand, business plan, expertise, equipment/supply access
    Franchisee: start own business, without risking it alone, or on an idea
                provide money & do the work
    Franchising: GM 1989 - "instead of paying salesmen, salesmen pay company".
      Car, soft drink, oil, motels used for initial growth.
      Fast-food then all retail emulated it.
      Allowed fast-food chains to expand; Wall street & banks did not fund them.
    McDonald's Kroc not greedy - $950 franchise fee;
      tested commitment by offering restaurants away from their home
      looked for people with common sense, guts and staying power, sense of hard work
      wanted loyalty devotion & promised to make them rich
        (some made more money than him)
      earned money by being a landlord (leasing restaurants) not from supplies...
    To Wall street investors: "McDonald's is real estate company... 15 cent burgers
       are greatest produces of revenue from which our tenants pay rent".
    Kroc paid secretary with stock, she get more money that the founders.
      Opened restaurant across from first McDonald's and drove it out of business.
    (Generation) Gap sold jeans like burgers in McDonald's...
    Louis Cheskin, a clinical psychologist/ marketing innovator:  keep golden
      arches - "mother McDonald's breasts" - universal/all-American symbolism

  Free enterprise with federal loans
    To open Carl Jr's o Burger Kings: $1.5 million
            McDonald's: $500K (McDonald's owns or holds building lease)
            lesser known: $50K
    Franchise Association claims: 92% franchises are successful,
      actual success: 62%,  independent business: 68%.
    Saturated fast-food market --> same chain restaurants closer (encroachment)
    --> less profits
    1978 first franchise law: prevent money pyramid schemes; disclosure document
      100's pages long; no other regulation - supplier kickbacks (rebates),
      encroachment, eviction WO cause are OK.
    Francisees: no federal laws to protect employees
               no laws that protect independent business
               no consumer protection laws
               waive rights to state law
               must buy from approved supplier regardless the price
    Franchisor may: take kickbacks (rebates) from suppliers
                    open new restaurant next door
                    terminate contract at discretion
    Subway, "worst francise in America", most  francisee lawsuits
      found by 17 year old DeLuca
      "geared to sell francises as it is to sell sandwiches"
      gets 100K for new restaurant & 8% of total revenues (highest)
      50% of francisees are immigrants
    IFA (Independent Financial Association):
      prevented "good faith" (Uniform Commercial Code) legislation
      franchising relies "on marketplace solutions"
      got financing from Small Business Administration (SBA)
        1967-1979 18,000 restaurants got loans 10% defaulted
        4% of independent businesses defaulted
        1996 Subway got the most loans

  World beyond pueblo
    Owner of Little Ceasar's in Pueblo Colorado, buys $90 tickets to Success
    seminar for 14 workers to hear Bush Cuomo Powell... talk.
      Audience of 18,000 hear:
        "Set goals to meet key people... for important people be prepared to
        be insightful about their achievements...attitude of a superstar...
        smile to tell them you like them...."
        Christopher Reeves (superman actor) in a wheelchair brings sanity:
        "None of it (success) matters"

5. WHY FRIES TASTE SO GOOD______________________________________________________
________________________________________________________________________________
  Idaho: altitude + warm days + cool nights + volcanic soil + irrigation = potato
         farming (Russet Burbank)
  J.R. Simplot: 1,200 workers dehydrated onions (gold dust) & potatoes for WW2
                used profits to buy ranches, farms and phosphate mine
                invested on frozen foods
                froze precooked french fries (cut, blanched, dried, fried)
  1950's: golden age of food processing:TV dinners, Jell-O, miracle whip...
  Restaurants: displayed canned soup, frozen food in table-side microwave
  1965 Simplot and Kroc (McDonald's) make potato agreement.
    potatoes more profitable than burgers
    Simplot grows/process corn, peas, broccoli, avocados, carrots, potatoes, feed
    process cattle, mines phosphate silica, produces oil, ethanol, & natural gas
    in 85,000 acres of irrigated farm land
    controls/leases land bigger than Delaware
    "I have been a land hog all my life"
    Abstractions/religion is "hocus-pocus"
    His empire: "it's big and it's real, it ain't bullshit"
    "The only thing I did smart I did not sell out I held on"

  Mistake of standing alone
    Fast food buys/sells french fries at $0.30/$6 per pound
    Potato oligopsony: few buyers exert power on may sellers
    Potato farmers:
      get 1/2 cent for every $1.00 spent on french fries
      plant 400 acres (average) for $500K - need to sell at $5/100lbs;
        worst year ever, 1996, sold $1.50/100lbs
        letting potatoes rot in field damages the land
      weather + world market + processor whims = price
      independent to point of poverty - did not form alliances
      forced to sell and manage CO farms - like England's sharecropping
      "fallacy of composition": what is good for individual will still be good
        when others do the same - example: standing up in concert for better view.
          more farm productivity via machines, chemicals... drives farmers off land
          the input/output (suppliers/processors) have more control
    Processors:
      MBAs from Harvard that do not know how potato is grown
      illegally talk to one another & set price
    Agriculture economy is lake hour glass: 1. top 2 million farmers,
      2. bottom 300 millions consumers, 3. narrow 12 COs profit on each transaction

    Food product design
      Customers food critics praised MacDonald's french fries;
        fried in 3% oil & 93% beef tallow - more saturated fat per oz. than burger
        1990 replaced tallow with "natural ingredient"
      Flavor industry: secretive;
        largest International Flavors & fragrances NJ 1958 (among plastic factory):
          like Willy Wonka's chocolate factory
          Snack & savory lab: chips, crackers, breads, cereal, pet food... flavor
          Confectionery lab: ice cream, cookies, mouth wash, toothpaste, antacids
          Beverage lab: soft drinks, beer, wine coolers, malt liquor, teas,....
          Preparing cookies, pizza, french fries, milkshakes ....
          Perfumes, sop, shampoo, floor wax, dish-washing detergent...
      Flavor is mostly smell, chewing releases volatile gases which float to
      olfactory epithelium.
      Food preferences, like personality, formed during first years of life
      via socialization.
      Aroma / memory are linked - happy meals makes adults return to McDonald's.
      Spic trade (flavor):
        Build empires, explored new lands, change religion/philosophies.
        Now determines rise/fall of food chains & companies.
      Methyl anthranilate discovered by accident; German lab filled with grape
        flavor; chief ingredient of Kool Aid
      European perfume/flavor tech came to NY, flavor tech moved to NJ.
      Additives in baked goods, candies and drinks until 1950's.
        Processed food & invention of gas chromatography increase synthetic flavors
        1960's flavoring in: Pop Tarts, Tang, Fillet-O-fish,...thousands other
        2000: 10,000 new processed foods per year; 9/10 fail.
      Flavor is very small measured by mass spectrometers in part per billion;
        human nose can do parts per trillion.
        Strawberry flavor: 350 chemicals
        Coffee, roasted meat: > 1,000 chemicals
        Dominant flavor of bell pepper: 0.02 parts per billion ;
          one drop per 5 average swimming pools, (color chemicals smaller concentration)
        Flavor costs less than packaging.
      No FDA requirement to disclose GRAS (Generally Regarded As Safe) additives.
        enables formulas to be secret.
      Typical strawberry artificial flavor (49 chemicals):
        amyl acetate
        amyl butyrate
        amyl valerate
        anethol
        ansil formate

        rose
        rum ether
        Î³-undecalactone
        vanillin
        solvent
      One chemical has dominant aroma; ethyl-2-methyl butyrate for apple.
      Processed foods are blank palettes.
        methyl-2-peridylketone : pop corn
        ethyl-3-hydroxybutanoate: marshmallow
      Without effecting nutritional value could add:
        3-methyl butanoic acid: cut grass smell
        3-methyl butanoic acid: body odor smell
      Natural flavor: 1. derived from natural source
                      2. "derived from out-of-date dated technology"
                      3. can have same chemicals as artificial flavor
      Amyl acetate (banana):
        1. natural flavor:    distill it from bananas with solvent
        2. artificial flavor: vinegar + amyl alcohol + sulfuric acid (catalyst)
      Natural flavor not necessarily healthier/purer;
        almond flavor (benzaldehyde):
          natural: from peach pits has traces of hydrogen cyanide poison
          artificial (& cheaper): clove oil and amyl acetate mixture
      "natural" is language bending and ironic....
      Flavorist: chemist (biology, psychology, physiology, organic chemistry)
        with trained nose and poetic sense - ensure consumer likability
        flavor like music: "top-note" --> "dry-down" --> "leveling-off"
          easy to analyze
      Food "mouth feel": texture & chemicals that effect flavor perception
        adjusted by fats, gums, starches, emulsifiers and stabilizers
        Mechanical measure (with difficulty): rheological properties:
          bounce,crunchiness, chewiness, grumpiness, juiciness...
      Biotechnology natural flavors via fermentation, enzymes, fungus...
      Butter flavor in liquid of flakes: fresh creamy, cheese, milky, savory...
      MacDonald's natural french fries secret flavor from "animal products"
      Natural smoke flavor: charring sawdust, capturing smoke into water.
      Close eyes and smell burger flavor: could swear that someone was in
        the room flipping burgers.
        Smell cherries, sauteed onions, black olives, shrimp
      A flavorist has "Old World old-fashioned sensibility which is out of step
      with our brand-conscious egocentric age".

  Millions and millions of fries
    Lamb Weston: makes McDonald's french fries & 130 other type of fries
      two football fields long and dark building with 20ft deep potatoes at 46F
      potatoes go though rock trap, peeled with steam,
      the Lamb Water Gun Knife shoot potatoes 80MPH to cut them,
      video cameras look for blemishes,
      compressed air removes blemished french fry and tiny knifes remove blemish
      spray of hot water blanches them, hot air dries them, fried slightly in
      25,000 lbs of boiling oil, air cooled by compressed ammonia freezes them,
      20 million pound stored in freezer.
      Every day 12 railroad cars and 24 tractor trailers took shipments.
      To maintain uniform taste, sugar added/leached in fall/spring.
        Freshly dug potatoes are taste tested.

6. ON THE RANGE_________________________________________________________________
________________________________________________________________________________
  The new (West) buries the old.
  West: wide-open countryside, beauty from the absence of people,
        attracts people, slowly loses its appeal
  A rancher: 400 cattle, "nature is not an abstraction - my family lives with it
             every day", house with 2 kids, a log cabin, looked very small.
    Ranch: range management inspired by elk & buffalo - not "raping the land"
           35 pastures, cattle stayed in pasture for 10 to 1 days
           then blue grama & buffalo grass recovered
           stream is fenced off to prevent grazing
             has gash 60/15 ft wide/deep from storm runoff from Colorado Springs
             carried silt/debris (part of the ranch) to Kansas
             (one rancher lost 10 acres in one day)
            runoff fix: holding ponds, landscaped greenways, permeable parking lots
    Speedway for summer weekend races next to ranch - a bad omen

  New Trust
    "Without receiving a fraction of the public attention given to the northwestern owl,
     ranchers have become endangered"
    Rancher problems: rising land price, low beef prices, oversupply of cattle,
                      increase shipment cost form Mexico/Canada, inheritance taxes,
                      development pressure,health concerns about beef
                      growth of food chains encourages meatpacker consolidation
    100 years ago corporate alliances controlled economy:
      steel trust, sugar trust, beef trust...
    antitrust laws 1890 & 1920 for beef
    1970 top 4 meatpackers slaughtered 21%. after Reagan 84%
      control 20% of live cattle (captive supplies)
        own some of the feeders
      when prices rise they flood market with beef
      do 80% of cattle exchanges (from captive supplies)
      sell prices are secret - not an open market - favors the wealthy
      no interested in ranching
    Ranchers share of retail dollar fell from $0.63 to $0.46

  The breasts of Mr. McDonald
    Ranchers fear beef being restructure like chicken:
      8 chicken processor control 2/3 of market - in south, low wages, no union...
      Chicken McNugget turned chicken farmers into serfs
    Tyson developed the "Mr. McDonald" chicken breed.
      supplies growers with: 1 day old chicks, feed, vet services, equipment,
                             "flock supervisors" to ensure quality
      7 weeks later collects chickens, and determines price based on weight
    Growers: $150K to house 25,000 chickens
             with 3 houses after 15 years earned $12K/year & was in debt
             1/2 growers quit after 3 years
               Arkansas littered with abandoned chicken houses
    McNuggets: made McDonald's  2nd largest purchaser after KFC
               fried in beef tallow - switched to vegetable oil with beef flavor
               still contain 2x fat then hamburgers
               1992 chicken consumption passed beef
    Growers sign waiving rights to filing law suit or join  any association

  Captives
    1976: peak 96 beef lbs/person/year --> decline --> beef oversupply & low prices
      --> ranchers use hormones --> bigger cattle --> not able to export to EU
    Packers:
      officials sent to prison price fixing lysine (fermented sugar)
      "Our competitors are our friends and our customers are our enemies"
      Production efficiency is efficiency in stealing
      Keep prices secret
    Ranchers afraid to testify against packers fearing retaliation/economic ruin

  Threat of wealthy neighbors
    Colorado ranchers' problems: 1. population growth; <$200/acre in 1960's -->
      $30K+/acre in 2000; each cow/bull needs 30 acres.
      2. inheritance tax claim more than half land value - ranchers are cash poor.
      3. culture erosion - high school has gangsta wannabes, skaters, stoners,
      goths, & punks but no cowboys (1959 8/10 top 10 TV shows were western)
      4. 55 is median age or ranchers  6. compete with gentlemen ranchers who
      do not need to get a profit.
    Solution: 40K acre conservation easements - tax break for not being able to sell land
      for housing, golf course...
      solution problems: 1. ranch land loss is 90K/year 2. easements benefit
      rich ranchers - lawyers, doctors...  3. easement for rich rancher increases
      land value of poorer neighbor rancher who is more likely to sell

  Broken link
    Interviewed rancher, age 43, committed suicide a week before Christmas;
      served on board, fine sense of humor, loved family... Possible cause(s):
       consolidating and homogenizing influence of fast food, tax laws favoring rich
    Rancher suicide = 3x national average, got attention in 9080s ranch crisis
      and ignored since.
    Rancher life destruction = rancher philosophy destruction
      Silicon valley  failure is first step toward success.
      What being sold matters less than how well it sells.
    "Broken Heartland": "To fail several generations of relatives...to see
       yourself as the one weak link in a strong chain...is a terrible,
       for for some, an unbearable burden"

7. COGS IN THE GREAT MACHINE____________________________________________________
________________________________________________________________________________
  Industrialization of cattle rising and meat packing:
    cut costs & wages, created migrant workforce, tolerate high injury rates,
    spawned rural ghettos,
    Smell of animals, and manure <--> crime/poverty/drub-abuse/homelessness
    Slaughterhouse: 2 feedlots 100K steer each
                    fatten cows with grain 3 months before slaughter;
                      3K lbs to gain 400 lbs
                      50 lbs manure urine / steer / day
                      more excrement than Denver, Boston, Atlanta, St. Louis
                    implant anabolic steroids (testosterone-like) in steers' ears
                      anabolism example: gluconeogenesis; liver and kidneys
                         produce glucose from noncarbohydrate sources
  Nathan Meeker found Greeley (his boss Horace Greeley:"Go West young man"),
    1870 Ute Indians killed and scalped him
  Greeley had 50 miles of fence to keep cattle out.
  Warren Monfort started grain feeding 18 steers
    by 1950's feeding 20K
      year-round grain feeding to get best price in Chicago
    1960 opened slaughterhouse
      good union jobs with long waiting list
    Greeley -> company town
    liberal democrat, opposed Vietnam war
  Grain-fed beef is fatty & tender - unlike grass-fed does not have to be aged for weeks

  Go West
    Before Greeley, slaughterhouses were urban - steer transported by rail and
      slaughtered in Chicago, Omaha, Kansas City, UN location in NY city
    Chicago slaughterhouse: 5 story building
      steer struck on head by sledge hammer on 5th floor
      ground floor: beef, canned beef, sausages loaded in rail-cars, to US Europe...
    Upton Sinclair: Chicago, world slaughterhouses capital:
      greatest capital/labor in one place;
        capitalism's supreme achievement & greatest disgrace
      "The jungle": sever back/shoulder injuries, lacerations, amputations,
         exposure to chemicals; man falling in vat and turned into lard;
         humans were "cogs in the great packing machine"
         --> food safety law 1906 - did not improve workers' lives;
         Sinclair: "i aimed for the heart and by accident hit the stomach"
     despite spies, blacklists, & black strikebreakers most workers were in union
       more pay than manufacturing
     IBP (Iowa Beef Packers): "take the skill out of every step"
       long assembly-like line of workers making same cut for thousand of times
       slaughter houses close to rural feedlots - away from urban unions
       shipped small beef cuts, hamburgers - no need for butchers in supermarkets
       turned leftovers into dog food
       anti-union; "conduct business as if waging war"
         real war --> strikers killer suspected company spy
         unionized NY butchers blocked sale of boxed IBP beef
           Moe Steinmam/mafia, ended boycott, got 5 cent/100lbs commission
           1974 IBP convicted of bribing union leaders, paid $7K
             no prison, judge note bribes were part of doing business
           Forbes, WSJ: IBP prime example how a company is infiltrated by the mob
       Chicago slaughterhouse moved to rural anti-union states; 50% lower wages
         40K workers --> 2K workers
         Union stockyard build 1875 million cattle/horse/people passing thru
           like archaeological site of lost civilization

  Bags of money
    1979 Greeley CO ugly strike: scabs death threats, worker sabotage
      plant closed;  Warren Monfort become pro-business republican
      1982 plant reopened with 40% less wages
    Reagan opposed using anti-trust laws; Monfort agreed to ConAgra takeover
    ConAgra (Latin partenship with land)
      largest food service supplier: french fries (Lamb Wesson subsidiary)
      sheep, turkey, chicken, port, agriculture chemicals, frozen food,
      flower miller, feed/seed producer & commodity future trader
      Hundreds of brands: Hunt's, Hebrew national, Swiss miss, Healthy choice
      1974 Charles Mike Harper took it over $10mil, $156mid debt
        general managers given bag of money & end of year expected to return more
          and a plaque: "Patience my ass" on vulture tells the other
                        "I am gonna go kill somebody"
          found guilty for tempering scales to make chicken lighter
            paid $17.2 mil fine
        1995 $13.6 mil settlement for catfish price fixing
        1997 $8.3 mil fine: wire fraud, misgrading crops, adding water to grain

  new industrial migrants
    1980s Monfort broke unions & hired new immigrants may illegal
        annual turnover 400%
    2000 2/3 workers cannot speak English - 1/3 cannot read/write in any language
    Advantage of high turnover rate, in federal hearing:
       "Insurance starts after a year, vacation accrue after 2 years...
        Frankly there are economies that result from new hires"
    Migrant workers: Oregon berries, Washington apples, Florida tomatoes...
    Industrial migrants: in Mexico Guatemala $5/day, California $5/hour stawberries
      Colorado $10/hour meat packing
    IBP recruits: refugee from Laos Bosnia, homeless, radio ads in Mexico, buses
      from rural Mexico.
      1/4 meat-packers are illegal.
      Executive: "if they have a pulse we'll take an application"
    Costs of migrants: no health insurance drives local medical costs & more crime
    GFI America promised housing to 39 people, bussed them from Mexicoto Minnesota
      homeless shelter.
      Homeless shelter denied offer of $17/person & hamburgers; "Our job is not
      to subside companies importing low-cost labor"
    1987 Mike Harper of ConAgra threatened governor to move out of Omaha;
      "Friday night turn off lights, click, click...and gone by Monday morning"
      with executive drafted tax bill for large companies, executives,
        and private jets (at 52 Harper got pilot license)
      legislators call it "black mail" but passed it
      The law subsidized new ConAgra/IBP job for $13 to $23K
        IBP paid not taxes in next 10 years
          but 1997 moved to South Dakota - no corporate or personal taxes
          started in 1960 with 300K small business loan;
            championed efficiency, crushed unions, used subsidies, had no loyalty

  sweet smell
    Greeley changes, rural ghettos, drugs, poverty, rootlessness, crime
      in high planes: Garden City Kansas, Grand Island Nebraska, Storm Lake Iowa;
      most dramatic in Lexington Nebraska:
        like a (deceptive) Norman Rockwell town.
        1990 IBP opens slaughterhouse a year highest crime in Nebraska
        in 10 years: gangs, drugs, drive-by shooting, double Medicaid cases
          whites moved, 10x Latino population (> 50%)
            Lexington --> Mexington
        3 odors: burning hair & blood, greasy smell, & rotten eggs (H2S)
          H2S (hydrogen sulfide) from manure lagoons
          2000 justice department forced IBP to cover lagoons
      IBP exceutives lied in 1988 public slaughterhouse forum in a school:
        1. 90% workers will be stable
        2. no hourly workforce
        3. no worry about type of people:
           in Emporia Kansas: "they work them so hard at IBP that they are tired
           and go home to bed", "chief of police said they go home at night and
           got to bed than carouse around town"
        4. no odor noticeable "a few feet away" from plant,
           in event of small emitted it would be "sweet"
           smell "no different than that which you produce in your kitchen"

7. MOST DANGEROUS JOB___________________________________________________________
________________________________________________________________________________
  Slaughterhouse: 3 stories, no windows, 5K steers /day
    "fab" room 40F: like supermarket, meat trimming & carving with Whizzards
      some women sweating (in freezing cold)
    Kill floor hot & humid: power saw slices cattle into halves as if they were 2x4
    Whizzards peel meat off heads leaving skull like that of Georgia O'Keefe
    Sticker for 8.5/day slits neck (carotid artery) of steers every 10 seconds.
    Knoker shoots steel bolts cattle in head with compressed air gun - unconscious
      animal's hind legs are shackled and lifted into the air.
    Path to knoker has hairpin turns preventing animals from seeing ahead.
    Cattle like dogs look you in the eye waiting for a treat...

  Sharp knives
    Job assignments: knocker, sticker, shackler, rumper, first legger,
    knuckle dropper, navel boner, splitter top/bottom butt, feed kill chain
    Injury rate = 3x industrial average
    1 out of 3 workers (43K) injured each year
    Poultry plants automated because of uniform size
      Cattle vary by hundreds of pounds
      Cumulative trauma: tendinitis, back, shoulder, carpal tunnel, "trigger finger"
        = 35x industrial average
    Knifes:brought home and sharpened for 40 minutes
      dull knife = injury
    Old Chicago meatpacking 50 cattle/hour - now 200 to 400/hour
    Competitive --> low profit margin --> faster pace --> more profits/injuries
      Efficiency is dangerous;
      Supervisors known to sell crack
      methamphetamine use increase injuries
    Injuries not reported: 2/3 workers are non-union,
      illegal immigrants earn 10x from home
      supervisor bonuses based on low injury rates
      injured assigned to easier job, or return to Mexico to recover,
        "they deter you from going to doctor"
      injured given unpleasant jobs and encouraged to quit
      Supervisors: Anglos late 20s early 30s, little dictator; can boss, fire,
        berate (criticize angrily), reassign, sexually abuse workers,
        Casanovas - multiple affairs,  assignations, sex & drugs
      Female workers: sex for green card, husband, easier job.

  The worst
    Cleaning crews:
      "independent contractors", mostly illegal, 1/3 pay of packers
      worst job in the US.
      arrive at midnight, high pressure 180F water with chlorine
        plant temperature exceeds 100F, visibility 5 ft
        throw up cleaning the rendering area
        at home soap does not take off smell
      Loose 2 fingers, next week come to work an use other hand.
      Scariest job: cleaning the roof vents in winter when windy
    Injury statistics not kept - workers are illegal, illiterate, impoverished
      Accidents: dehiding machine beheaded worker
         conveyor belt cogs tear apart worker
         pork-loin machine crushes worker's head
           same happened few years earlier
         worker overcome by H2S, 2 try to help, all 3 die
           same happened 8 years earlier
           OSHA fine: $480 / death

  Don't get caught
    Line speed increased, illegal immigrants hired, Reagan cut safety low
    enforcement (OSHA)
    OSHA director to executives: "you know more about safety than I do"
    "Voluntary compliance": OSHA looks at accident logs, if accident rate is
      lower than national average cannot do inspection.
       --> encourage "record falsification and accident cover-up"
    IBP 2 logs: 1,800/160 injuries; "IBP...most irresponsible & reckless"
      fined $6M later reduced to $1M, executives not charged with perjury.
      nurse called injured workers:idiots, jerks, cry-babies, full of shit
      staff members got bonus when lost workdays was kept low.
    Monfort told safety director: "only production counts...do what I tell you
       even if is illegal... don't get caught"
    Loss of arm & a death by ammonia explosion  --> plant closed -->
      safety director fired --> opened/closed in two years  --> penalty (rare)
      for inhumane treatment of cattle.

  Value of an arm
    Workers; comp: no-fault insurance; immediate benefits & no law suits.
    "Workers comp reform": Company chooses doctor who determines injury level.
    Visible/invisible injuries are paid/litigated.
    Colorado law: arm is $36K, finger $2.2K to 4.5K, public disfigurement $2K
    Clinton revitalized OSHA;
      1994 republic win limited OSHA and proposed to end OSHA

  Kenny
    "we are human beings but they treat us like animals"
    Kenny left school at 13, never learned to read, 6'5", hauled 120lbs
    90lb box fell knocking him into conveyor belt, gears pierced his lower back,
    wife + 3 children, 3 moths extreme pain, disc surgery, pain persisted,
    got divorced, 14 months return to work, did not like unions, help new plant,
    assigned heavy work, pain got worse, assigned to unpleasant job (to quit).
    given paper mask to decontaminate tank with chlorine, one month in hospital
    with body blisters & burned lungs, went back to work, remarried, drove truck
    disoriented and struck by a train, 2 weeks in hospital, back to work, saved
    a worker from death,given award, broke leg by stepping into a hole,
    shattered ankle and had 5 steel pins, wore metal brace to walk, given job
    to recycle knives, had massive heart attack, learned that he was fired when
    his payments to company health insure were returned by post office
    (nobody told him); worked at company for 16 years.
    --> permanent heart damage, immune system shot, back & ankle hurt,
        coughs blood, wife recovering from kidney surgery & unemployed
    After 3 years got $35K settlement. (-15% for lawyer).
    Biblical anger at Monfort: "They used me to the point where I had no body
    parts to give... then they trashed me to trash can"
    At 45, feels useless as though his life is over.

9. WHAT'S IN THE MEAT___________________________________________________________
________________________________________________________________________________
  35M hamburgers contaminated by Escherichia coli 0157:417, but 25M eaten.
  E coli 0157:
    1982 discovery (HIV 1983), diarrhea from under-cooked hamburger
    healthy cattle primary reservoir --> irrigation , soil, birds...
    30% infections from vegetables; embedded bacteria
    one bacteria can cause infection
    Shiga toxin --> intestine damage --> bloody diarrhea -->
    possible haemolytic uraemic syndrome --> 3%-5% death rate
    antibiotics increase development of HUS

  Ideal system for new pathogens
    1/4 population / year has bout of food poisoning
    200K/year sickened, 14 die (under reported)
    food-borne pathogens; possible: heart disease. irritable bowl, neurological,
    autoimmune, kidney damage.
    Industrialized food increased rate with global impacts
    Feedlots, slaughterhouses, meat grinders facilitated spread
    (HIV spread via air travel & promiscuity)
    food-chains --> uniformity demand --> meat industry --> efficient E. coli spread
    emergent pathogens:
      Campylobacter jejuni - chickens/fish/produce; antibiotics; 24 deaths /year
      Cryptosporidium - lake/stream water; contact anything contaminate with stool
      Cyclospora cayetanensis - parasite, tropics, stool contaminated
      Listeria monocytogenes - meningitis, encephalitis, refrigerated ready-to-eat foods
      Norwalk-like virus (norovirus):  winter vomiting bug, fecalâ€“oral route
         fluids, fingers, flies, food, fields, fomites
         most common cause of gastroenteritis 50 K childern deaths/year
         cause Open defecation
    3/4 of food caused deaths are by non identified pathogens
    Government can force recall of consumer products but not food.
    Unusual power of meat packing sustained by Republicans and lack of awareness
    USDA 1996 survey of ground meat:
      7.5% Salmonella: meat, eggs, milk, fruits, vegetables
      11.7% Listeria monocytogenes: grows at 0C meat/vegetables 1/4 is fatal
      30% Staphylococcus aureus: 30% people carry in nose, share personal items
      53.3% Clostridium perfringens: decaying plants, 6.3 min generation time
      78% spread by fecal material
    Food poisoning tech terms:
      coliform levels; bacteria in environment and in feces of warm blooded animals
         acceptable 0/100ml of water
      aerobic plate counts: maximum 5x10^5 microorganisms/g in fish; indicator
        of quality, shelf life,  not food hazards.
        Breakfast cereal 0-100/g, walnuts 30K/g to 2M/g
      sorbitol: natural sweetener (sugar alcohol) or hydrogenated glucose (corn)
       very gassy in apples bananas, oranges, dried fruit...
       no tooth decay (like xylitol or stevia)
      MacConkey agar - isolate gram negative and mark lactose fermenters
        has peptides, file salts, lactose ...
    Plain talk, hamburger can make you sick because there shit in it.

  National dish
    Early 1900's hamburger: "food for the poor"; "as safe as getting it from trash can"
    First hamburger chain 1920's sponsored experiment of medical student eating
      nothing but hamburger & water for 13 weeks.
      Male, working class, urban customers in East & Midwest.
    Before/after WW2 pork/beef most popular meat
    Hamburger popular with children 7-13
    1993 children with bloody diarrhea had hemolytic uremic syndrome (HUS)
      (destruction of red blood cells & excess urea in blood)
      Cause: under-cooked hamburgers in Jack in the Box had E. coli 0157:H7
        700 people got sick 200 hospitalized 4 died
        10% got it from other people
      Jack in the Box almost goes out of business
    1982 dozen kids sick MacDonald's quietly cooperated with CDC, claimed:
      "possibility of statistical association of few cases & our restaurant"
      Little media reporting.
    E. coli 1993 to 2000: 500K sick, thousands hospitalized and hundreds died.

  A bug that kills children
    E. coli help digestion,synthesize vitamins, & stop pathogens.
    E. coli O157:H7 releases verotoxin (kills vero cells green monkey kidney cells)
      or Shiga (Japanese doctor) toxin - attacks intestines
      O157 plasmid (extrachromosomal DNA; replicon)
    4% of reported E. col 157, Shiga toxin enter blood causing HUS
    5% children with HUS die, survivors with brain damage, blindness...
    Mother started Safe Tables Our Priorities (--> Stop Foodborne Illness) after
      son died - his brain liquefied
    Adult 6 months after E. coli O157 infection, urinated blood (kidney infection)
    Antibiotics cause more Shiga toxin release;
      only treatment: fluids, transfusion, dialysis
    E. coli O157:H7 is tough:
      Resistant to acid, salt, chlorine
      Can live in counter-top/moist-environment for days/weeks.
      Withstands 32F & 160F
      5 bacteria can cause infection (million for Salmonella)
    Infections from:
      drinking water, lake, water park, crawling in carpet,
      cattle manure contact:
        bean sprouts, salad greens, cantaloupe, salami, raw milk & cider
      most common: ground beef
    Person-person infection:
      poor hygiene, from asymptotic, in families/day-car/senior center
      average 2 weeks infectious - up to 2  to 4 months
    American cattle infected decades ago,
      but food industry improved transmission;
      via feedlots:
        like city in Middle ages - chamber pots out of windows
          Cattle in pools of manure - dirt is not-OK/OK with people/animals
          Bacteria replicates in troughs & survives in manure for 90 days.
        until 1997 75% cattle fed sheep/cattle remains, dead cats/dogs from shelters
        were banned after mad-cow disease,
          but pigs, poultry, horses, and cattle blood are still used;
            Americans who lived in UK in 1980s cannot donate blood
            poultry OK to eat cattle
        Trade journal editor: "God-damn it, cattle are ruminants... designed
          to eat grass/grains...not other animals"
        poultry waste products (sawdust & newspaper litter) in cattle feed:
          3 million lbs chicken manure fed to cattle; may have:
            Salmonella - high fecal content
            Campylobacter - in chicken feces, usually mild
            Tapeworms - port, beef, fish; 1mm to 15m (Taenia saginata in beef)
            Giardia lamblia parsite - treatable with antibiotics
            antibiotic residue - antibiotic bacteria, allergy, cancer
            arsenic - in chicken (roxarsone; speeds growth) feed & rice
              (natural, inorganic & toxic)
              2011 Co stopped selling roxarsone
            other heavy metals - cadmium, lead
      via hide removal:
        inadequately cleaned hide; dirt manure falls into meat.
      via digestive system removal:
        pulled by hand - 60/hour/worker - spillage is 20%
          takes 6 months to do it without spillage in 1/200
        knifes not disinfected every few minutes
        illiterate workers do not understand hygiene
    1%/50% cattle in winter/summer have E. coli O157
    One plant 800K lbs hamburgers/day
      one animal can infect 32K lbs hamburger
    1/4 Hamburgers from worn dairy cows, likely sick, with antibiotic residue.
      dairy cows: 40 year lifespan  but slaughtered after 4 years (milk peak)
                  inexpensive and low fat meat
    Single hamburger: meat from dozens to hundreds of different cattle
      multiple sex partners ---> AIDS
      animal admixture ---> E.coli O157:H7

  all we care to pay
    Upton Sinclair: "this no fairy story and no joke... man would not remove a
      rat even when he saw one...a poison rat was a tidbit"
        Slaughter of diseased animals
        Borax and glycerin to disguise spoiled beef
        mislabeling of canned meat
        workers urinating/defecating on kill floor
        reply: "Men will are men... hard to control them"
      --> Meat inspection act 1906
      Meatpacking industry playbook:
        denied problem exists
        impugn motives of critics
        fight against federal oversight
        avoid responsibility for food poisoning
        shift cost of safety to general public
        Morris executive: "we are paying all we care to pay"
    NAS 1985: visual olfactory inspection is hopelessly outdated
    Reagan, Bush cut spending despite record falsification;
      1988 launched "Streamline Inspection Service" - industry self-inspection;
           discontinued at 1993 after Jack in the Box
      American Meat Institute: "recent outbreak sheds light on nationwide problem:
                             inconsistent information about cooking temperature"
      USDA: "...E. coli O157:H7 not cause for condemnation of the product"
    Clinton, USDA declares ban & testing of E. coli O157:H7
      American Meat Institute files lawsuit
        Conservative cattleman judge dismiss it.

  Matter of Will
    After a week Jack in the Box tried to blame suppliers and health dept, then
      hired David Theno:
        previously eliminated most Salmonella in chicken packing plant, advocated
        HACPP (Hazard analysis and critical control points):
          identify & eliminate  "critical failure areas"- biological,chemical,
          radio-logical
          --> NASA 1960s for space flight food
          --> Pillsbury after glass contaminants in baby food & botulism in
              under-processed low-acid canned food
          --> drugs & cosmetics
          1. do hazard analysis
          2. find critical control point;  hazard prevented eliminated or reduced
          3. set critical limits for each critical control point; '' '' ''''
          4. ''  critical control point monitoring limits
          5. ''  corrective action for exceeding limits
          6. ''  procedures for ensuring the HACPP system is working as intended
                 plants validate their of HACPP plants;
                 via scientific evidence for critical limits
          7. ''  record keeping procedures of above;
                 monitoring, verifying, and validating of the daily work
          Applications: fish 1995 for all importers, water 1994, ---> ISO 22000
        Prevention  via science & common sense
        instead on replying on suppliers safety standards impose own
        Farm to fork policy
        1. Jack in Box attend food safety course
        2. refrigerated delivery trucks have record keeping thermometer
        3. grill person use tongs for hamburger patties
        4. suppliers require to test beef for pathogens
        Supplier manager: "you cannot manage what you don't measure"
          patty production records: date, time, employees, slaughter house, feedlots
          that sent cattle to slaughter house
        Push-back from restaurants & suppliers; "if you do not know you do not
        have to deal with it"
        Believes in solving E. coli O157:h7 problem.
        Problem solvable with grading system: A,B(improve),C(do dog-food):
          "a matter of will not technology""

  Lack of recall
    Gingrich attacked Clinton's food inspection program
      received more money from restaurant industry than any other congressman
      same for McConnell, Helms, Gram (wife in board of IBP)
    USDA cannot demand recall, can remove inspectors for shutting down plant
    USDA told Hudson of E coli in patties
      Hudson did nothing --> 3 weeks 2nd E. coli --> Hudson recalls 20K lbs
      (plant produces 400K/day) --> media attention --> 35M lbs recalled
      (most was eaten) --> plant shutdown
      Managers indicted for misleading USDA but found innocent
    Recall does not need to be made public;
      COs afraid for litigation from "everyone with stomach ache"
      Press release: recall is good will/advertisement - not where/when/how
      Recall 6 weeks after initial case - most meat eaten
    Federal fines for: airline, cars, mining, steel, & toy industries.
      "can fine circus for mistreating elephants  ... not food industries..."

  our friend the atom
    1996 watered law to adopt HACPP in 10 years:
      record kept by company not neede to be revealed to government
      E coli testing not requires
      contaminated food could still be sold
      diminished inpectors authority to detect & remove
      HACPP is good as the people running them;
        1997 under HACPP, Hudson recalled 35M lbs beef.
      Former QC: HACCP great on paper, overwhelmed on person - needed 3 persons
      Meatpacker fought food safety but spent millions on safety equipment:
        Pasteurization cabinet: beef bathes at 200F steam for eight seconds
          kills most on E coli O157
          not concern for consumers but for carcass in outrail waiting for
          FDA inspection - for outside (non IBP) sale
        Irradiation: 1. cobalt-60 5.2 yr 1/2-life 1.22 Mev gamma, 0.3 MeV beta
                        synthetically; cobalt-59 + neutrons
                        minute quantity in reactors; iron --> Co59 --> Co50
                        cancer treatment, as tracer
                     2. cesium-137 30 ''   ''   , 0.66                0.5
                        fission of plutonium and uranium (strontium-90 29 yr)
                        problematic; low boiling pt(671C) gets in the air
                          high water solubility; Fukushima Cs 137 spread globally
                     3. 7.5 Mev x-arays from linear accelerator
                        Titan 1980s for Star Wars antimissile
          bacteria not killed but disabled to reproduce
          6 feet thick walls
          AMA & WHO: irradiated foods are safe, consumers reluctant
          FDA: irradiated food has to have radura (radiation+durus(lasting))
            but not if irradiated ingredients are added to non-irradiated food.
            Industry: radura voluntary & "irradiated" --> "cold pasteurization"
          Not good: 1. High tech with illiterate workers
                    2. speedup the kill line, more (sterile) feces in food

  What kids eat
    FDA's National School Lunch: cheapest ground meat from Cattle King
      cheapest: pathogens, spinal cord, bone, gristle, dead cattle, roaches, rats
                company owner, ex-convict, convicted again.
    1998 Boy seriously ill with E coli O157 --> USAD withdraws inspectors -->
      company owner commits suicide --> 6M lbs detained --> 11 children sick
    1999 47% of ground meat with Salmonella (high fecal content); 45% of school
      hamburgers --> company shut down --> company sued USDA (Salmonella is natural)
      --> company reopens --> 180K lbs E coli recall --> USDA continued purchases
    2000 ground meat for schools to be tested, no sick cattle: industry opposed it

  your kitchen sink
    1990s fed standards for school meat lower than fast food's
      fast food's buying power --> cleanest ground meat; not for consumer
    raw meat in kitchen --> potential bio-hazard
      on average more fecal bacteria in sink than in toilet seat -->
      "better off to eat carrot that fell in toilet than in kitchen sink"
    Virus, with gene to produce Shiga toxins, infects E coli creating E coli O157?
      possibly spread of virus encouraged by antibiotics in cattle feed.
      100 other E coli mutants produce Shiga toxins 1/3 cause illness
      Symptoms 2-5 (up to 1-8) days after infection, little or no fever
      Illness 5-10 days
      Most dangerous: 0103 0111 026 0121 0145
      CDC: per year: 37K poisoned, 1K hospitalized, 25 die
    Regardless of HACCP, automated grills, gamma radiation, safety depends
      on kitchen workers (food safety should be mandatory; similar to pilots...)
      In documentary, workers found to:
        sneeze into hands
        lick salad dressing
        picking noses
        flicking cigarettes
      Burger King teen workers arrested for:
        putting spit, urine,& cleaning products into food for 8 months.
      Teens worker informants:
        food safety depends on manager
        would no eat anything unless they made it
        food dropped on floor would is served
        worker did not wash hands after working om his car
        milk shake machine infested with roaches
        mice urine defecated on hamburger rolls


10. GLOBAL REALIZATION__________________________________________________________

        Sweden, Norway, Ireland.. banned children advertising
        95% of food adds in EU was for high fat/sugar/salt
          McDonald's had most ads

          Have to prove accuracy of statements using primary sources (witness)
            Peer-review articles not admissible
        Defendants:
          Three apologized to McDonald's in court.
          Helen Steed 24 year old gardener, minibus driver, bartender &
          Dave Morris 18 single father former postal worker.
            Sued because they passed out leaflet (not for writing it)
            Denied legal counsel and forced to defend in front of judge.
            Helped by secretary of Haldane Society of Socialist Layers
            Proved indefatigable (tireless) researchers
          Morris:  McDonald's arrogance is manifestation of larger problem:
                   multinationals free to move capital
                   with no allegiance to nations, farmers, workers consumer
                   Like Ra Kroc was charismatic, true believer, with ideas
                     outside mainstream
          Appealed to House of Lords which rejected suit.

          Filed appeal with European Court of Human Rights

            2005 verdict: UK government violated right to freedom of expression
              (Article 10) Â£60K fine against UK government
        Plaintiff:
           McDonald's; tactical error: everything was libelous.
             not the extreme "McDonald's using poisons to destroy rain forest"
             included "fat, sugar, salt linked with cancer"
           Top executives force to testy
           1/2 Greenpeace attendants were corporate spies.
             spying was from 1989 to 1991

               broke into Greenpeace

            Picked on the wrong people
        Judge:
          Rodger Bell; 800 page judgment
            McDonald's did exploit children through advertising,
              endanger health of its customers
              pay workers unreasonably low wages
              oppose union activity
              responsible for cruelty to animal
            Â£60K fine
        Trial:
          Longest in British history
          40K/18K pages of documents/transcripts
          Suit submitted 1990, trial started 1994, ended 1997
          1999 "heart disease & poor worker treatment" overruled
            Â£60K fine reduced to Â£40K
            McDonald's said that it would not collect fine
            wanted case to go away

  Back at the ranch
    East Germany, Ronald McDonald statues replaced Lenin's; one 3 stories high
      Plauen dilapidated but McDonald's, clean, cheerful, with young/old...
        Thirst for freedom/idealism replaced with consumerism
        10% population loss & 20% unemployment after reunification
        McDonald's franchisee:
          vacation in Florida;
          attribute success to luck but...
            headed state-controlled monopoly under Communism
            had right skills/connections
       High unemployment --> political instability;
         Right extremists declared some east parts "foreign free"
           "Germany for Germans"
           but McDonald's is
           not considered foreign
       "The Ranch" opened 1990 (with McDonald's) in Plauen
         American and Confederate flags
         Western shops selling boots, hats... to teens
           Teens in Colorado Springs could not care less
         Dancers:
           Members of American Car club with Ford/Chevy trucks come from miles
           Ages 7 to 70, mostly working class, many unemployed
           Marloboro smokers
           Listen to Willie Nelson, Johnny Cash, Garth Brooks
           Free line-dancing lessons

EPILOGUE: HAVE IT YOUR WAY______________________________________________________
________________________________________________________________________________
  Lasater ranch Colorado 30,00 acres: no pesticides, herbicides, commercial
   fertilizers, growth hormones, steroids, antibiotics, killing predators, hunting
   philosophy: "Nature is smart as hell".
   Dan Lasater:
     grandfather fought Beef Trust,
     father dropped out of Princeton to become rancher;
       bred cattle to be gentle fertile and strong --> registered as Beefmaster
     spent year in Argentina as Fullbright scholar
     believes that industrialized system is not sustainable
       cannot feed cattle grain while millions starve
     Grass fed cattle less likely to spread E. coli 0167
  "new urbanism": reduce dependence on car;
   human-scaled urban design; walkways, jobs, housing, shopping...
   bad aspect: it is confined to boundaries
  In-N-Outs (UnMcDonalds): 150  restaurants in California refused to franchise
   verses of bible in bottom of cups
   workers get full benefits
   do use microwaves, heat lamps, freezers
   ground beef is fresh, potatoes pealed, milk shakes from ice cream
   got highest ratings - McDonald's the lowest

  scientific socialists
    Triumph of fast food preordained
      companies avoid  free market by eliminating or absorbing rivals
    1990s Pentagon subsidized computer, software, aerospace, satellite industries
      Defense budget --> industrial policy; quasi socialist system  --> unplanned results
       Internet began as ARPANET - military in 1970s
       Government shaped economy history, more than free market
    free market is useful tool, what you make of it, not to worship
      non-free-market:
        abolish child labor, minimum wage, national parks, dams, roads, food safety
    technology similar...
      missiles can carry nuclear weapons or satellites....
      judge it by purpose and effects
    Blind worship of science: Soviet Union; "scientific socialism" highest truth
      --> massive environmental devastation
    20th/21th centuries: struggle to control totalitarian/corporate powers
      Free market more important than democracy
    Fast food low prices not its real cost
    Obesity cost = 2x fast food revenues
    Companies reduced air pollution, fast food should reduce obesity

  what to do
    Ban children advertising; like Norway, UK, Iran...
      (More than 90% children eat at McDonald's)
      Ban would encourage more healthy meals
    Subsidized job training with minimum employment for 1 year
    Enforce minimum wage & overtime
    Laws to facilitate unions
    Adequate school funding to eliminate school advertising
    Safer fast food in schools than food-chains
      E.coli 0157 testing started 7 years after jack in the box
      Sweden started Salmonella elimination 40 years ago - now 0.1% catle have it
    Prohibit animal waste in feed
    Eliminate competing bureaucracies - 12 agencies & 28 congressional committees
      cheese pizza/eggs:FDA  pepperoni pizza/chickens:USDA
      USDA: promote & police agriculture not compatible
      FDA: mostly drugs; more food poisonings than drug overdoes;
           junkies know the risk, fast-food customers do not
    No Salmonella in Swedish/Dutch eggs; 2020: 420 people die in US
      More food poisonings than drug overdoes
    Slow down slaughter line speeds (300/hr = 3x Dutch)
      Nebraska workers liked when processing for EU - line speed slowed down;
      fewer injuries.
    Tougher sanctions, criminal charges for work injuries;
      1/3 of meat workers injured every year;
    Powerful unions encourage inefficiencies, but companies WO unions behave like
      criminal enterprises
    Migrant workers undermine democracy
    Independent farmers (vs Soviet centralized farming) -->
      large agriculture industry  -->
      "veggie libel laws" (False Disparagement of Perishable Food Products Act of 1995)
         Oprah in trouble for saying she could not eat burger because of mad-cow
         in 13 states, like UK, burden is on defendant
         in Colorado it is criminal

  how to do it
    Congress cannot do it - lobbies...
    Consumer demand can... McDonald's Corp. stopped expanding McDonald's but
      expands Domino's, Chipotle,...
    Consumer activism - like Nike's sweatshop suppliers
    Fast-food self regulation - demand supplier quality & work conditions
    Publicity; McDonald's: Switched from polystyrene to paper boxes,
                           (continues to use them overseas)
                           Recruited African-American franchisees
                           Demanded non-genetically modified potatoes;
                             because of European Frankenfoods protests,
                             Monsanto's New Leaf plummeted
      Challenge to big Companies small compared to East German revolt
    Stop buying it; businessmen are not bad - will respond to grass beef demand..
      most irresistible is most mundane
    Walk in - look at kids, toy ads, colored photographs - think of where the food
      came from - how where - place order - or turn & walk.

      Favorite book: The overstory
      The idea that an employer gives you time off to consume a drug the company
      provides free of charge should tell you all you need to know about the
      ties between capitalism and caffeine.
