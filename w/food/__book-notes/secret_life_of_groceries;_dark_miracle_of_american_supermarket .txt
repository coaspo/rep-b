Between the ice and you

  The smell of cleaning a Whole Foods fish case (removing the frozen ice) in
  Manhattan was much much worse than the rotten fish in a loading dock.

  Spend 2% of our life shopping - in 2018 spent $701B 10% of budget; 30% in 1950's
  In 1812 90% of people produced food - now 3%

  Solved hunger, nutritional deficiency, food-borne illness in 100 years.
                       Problems: 1. too much food, 2. food to distribute ethical responsibility
            3. food as proxy for control of detached lives.

  Flashbulb memory: abundance in a grocery store after coming back from Kenya
  "see myself and my country  with fearful and reverent eyes"

A secular revelation

  Average store has 32K Shop Keeping Units (SKUs), Large stores 120K SKUs
  Machine kills 140 chicken/minute - animal --> food.
  In store removed from boxes;       food   --> product, merchandise (SKUs)
           put into shopping cart;   product--> food

  Maw (mouth) is secular revelation of destruction/creative always in need
  fed 3 to 30 times/day.
  We make serving the need complicated - ends in contradiction; beautiful & vile.
  Grocery is not about food it is about desire.

SALAD DAYS AT TRADER JOE'S______________________________________________________
"Fruit must be beautiful, taste is not necessary"

The fourth Bibson (dry martini with onion) corporation.
  Guerneseys cows (orange like high fat high protein milk) replaced with
  Holstein (low fat white milk) eating grain and producing milk.
  1965, on fourth martini (Trader) Joe that his supplier's farm was sold to Soutland;
  Joe (small chain stores) was doomed - left without a milk supplier - he took
  a vacation with his family to the Caribbean....to read the history of the grocery industry.
  1890 Southland manufactures and distributes (in "ice docks") in Texas.
  1927 Southland opens 7-Eleven 7AM to 11PM for ice and quickly add groceries.
  Joe hired best talent, non-bullshit, wore jeans to Bank of America.
  His Theory Papers: cultural forecasts, currency fluctuations, education trends,
  philosophical tracts, military planning strategy, and ecological theory to
  predict consumer trends - example: "Cash reserves must be accompanied by a mental
  organizational posture which is ready with creativity"

From Ape to Man
  General store: clothing, boots, basins, flower, sugar, molasses, drugs:
    1. opium[pain, insomnia], 2. rhubarb[gut], 3. laudanum[opium alcohol;
    for women & babies; pain/insomnia; now for diarrhea and coke babies],
    4 turpentine[skin, muscle/joint aches, lice, parasites, now inactive
    ingredient in Vicks]), meat with flies, ammonia as preservative, cat for
    rodent control
    People used credit and paid once or twice a year.
  1817 Paperboard, precursor to cardboard, 1890 cardboard labeled boxes
    colors slogans --> choice --> advertise (box is proxy to security)
    1611 Welsh coal fields --> bottle manufacture --> brands --> potions
  1916 self-serve Piggly Wiggly store (thought of as lunacy;  theft 6%, now 1.7%)
    1893 Word Expo cafeteria --> 1913 Ford assembly line -
    inspiration: customers are like pigs when charging a clerk.
  1930 King Kullen supermarket- cheap prices via volume, housewives felt dizzy;
    circus like, happy infantilization, now live in a pristine organic Eden
    6,000 sq. ft, now Cosco ~200,000 sq. ft
    1956 expo in Rome, built American supermarket with 2,500 items - a woman
    ran in aisles shouting "it must be heaven.. mountains of food",
    1956 Khrushchev in a supermarket: "admiration of what I see"
    and in 1989 Yeltsin: "if Russians saw this there would be a revolution"
  Trader's Joe products with identity; highest grocery sales per sq. ft
    best co to work for; evangelical customers, TV dinners WO "artificial"
    ingredients, invented almond butter
    But quality is typical; FDA's nickname is Recall Joe's

A black Sheep founder
  Joe dropped out of Stanford, joined air force (best thing - met different people).
    To spot wildlife need to go to boundary of two habitats --> insights come from
    cultural contrast - Joe traveled all over wearing a uniform.
    Get MBA and is married.  Works as apprentice in grocery store - after work
    took notes asking questions - "best way to get education"
    Whole family did demographics - drive around count bicycles, boats, stores...
    Pays workers well 7K/year (median income), calculate product value/cubic inch
    Pronto markets: bullets, hosiery, ice cream, booze with expensive employees.

The one Day an Egg Guy Walks in the Door
  Nobody wanted AAA eggs, cheaper than AA, because it was discontinuous supply.
  Discontinuous supplies are real bargains.
  Perverse state laws: "We find a loophole and drive a truck through it"

Groceries a Divination
  "Better educated, not more intelligent...college gave them different vocabulary"
  GI bills increased college graduates
  1965 747 cut air travel cost in half by one year; travel was education.
  There would be consumers (mainstream) and customers...

Tap the admiral
  education/alcohol correlation is as perfect in marketing
  Alcohol highest value/cubic inch
  Mimic the Disneyland jungle cruise - sell sophistication - marine artifacts/
  employees in Polynesian skirts, Bermuda shorts, manager the captain
  Victorian sketches were free
  customer: the educated traveler.
  Joe first to discover no price controls on imported wine, blinded wine tasting.
  Treat other groceries like wine.

Quote Health Foods
  Health food nuts same as the wine nuts - both assert individuality.
  Create supply line of nuts, Sell canned corn like wine, Separate  coffee by climate.
  Let buyer's decide, non-sellers removed; went from 15K SKUs to 1.5K SKUs
  Sell 'outstanding' products - better quality and lower price than else where.
  Private label or generic - no advertising cost.
  Meaningful private label - people to buy beyond novelty - switch from coal
  to electricity - no MSG/sugar/coloring.
  Create silent conspiracy in over-educated underpaid people, served by under educated
  golden retrievers.
  Joe made business a creative art.

Every Beginning is an End
  Albrecht German brothers - ALDI (discount), same store offerings count & cost
  6K sq ft, 280 SKUs, spurred postwar recovery.
  They bought Trader's Joe - it was Joe's ambulation.
  Theo Albrecht kidnapped for two weeks - becomes more secretive & recluse.

DISTRIBUTION OF RESPONSIBILITY__________________________________________________

3 AM outside ALDI distribution center in Oak Creek Wisconsin
  Ag-gag law - forbid undercover photography/filming to protect agriculture industry.
  1.5% profit margin  promotes trade secrets - no visits allowed in warehouses.
  Truckers talk to themselves, isolated, unwilling to eat/pee off the truck.
  Truckers: everything in your life comes on a truck.
  12.6 million drivers; 11 billion tons/years - 350 lbs per day per man-woman-child
  1. Driver: long haul or OTR (over the road) - non-dedicated route
  2. Planner: overseer of truck loads - can reward punish drivers
  3. Dispatcher:  messenger between planner and driver
  4. Dog: sanity provider
  5. Receiver: where load get delivered
  6. Lumper: truck unload - not employee of shipper/trucker to avoid liability
  7. Producer: food manufacturer
  To unload/load may take 30 min to 5 (unpaid) houMaximum Expansion of Alpinesrs

Another $100 workweek
  For 1,050 miles $1,231 ($1.21/mile) gross+ $368 fuel surcharge,
  28% of gross and 10% of fuel by trucking Co for driving in the fleet.
  $300/week truck lease, fees for: lumper, cleaning service, fuel additives
  $500 left for entire trip.  Theoretically 6 mpg; actual 4.5 mpg
  Regardless cost of extra expense (repair) get $100/week.

Debt and hope
  Trucking recruiters go to homeless shelters, prison release programs.
  Student drivers have 3K to 8K debt.
  Trucking blue collar from 1935 to 1980 - anti competitive, inefficient, opposed.
  Carter signed deregulation - cheaper groceries but at a human cost / disposable.
  Annual turnover is 95% to 112%, Starbucks 65%, lawyers 17%.
  Trucking industry makes most profit from student drivers.

Churn and burn
  Team driving - out of CDL (comm. driv. lic.) school paired with trainer.
    One drives, other sleeps - coast to coast shrinks from 7 to 2.5 days.
    Couples, brothers, strangers result in fights
  Limits: 14 hours for engine start/stop, 11 hours driving, 70 hours for 8 days.
  Recruiter: "think hard they own you for 10 months"

They own you
  Pressure drivers into teams - sharecroppers on wheels - cut miles until you sign.
  DAC (drive-a-check report) is like truckers credit - controlled by employer.
  5% women truckers - abused, assaulted, threatened
  Shipper/receiver, unaware of drama, only love results.

The results
  Distribution center lab checks fruit sugar - may reject produce - is like NICU
  (premature) Newborn Intensive Care Unit;
  Control with ethylene (C2H4 as anesthetic and for metal cutting)
    Apples kept dormant for a year,
    Cherries stabilized for 2.5 months.
    Bananas avocados tomatoes in between.
    Leafy greens for 3 weeks (used to last 3-4 days).
    Blueberries from Chile to Maine 45 days
    Waxed, treated with chemicals, dusted with bioflavonoids (anti fungal and bacterial)
    Seeing huge quantity of non-perishables:Maximum Expansion of Alpines
       Materialism: our ability to inject meaning into things.
  Truckers: persistent, vigilant, chin-tucked, angry, conspiratorial, paranoid,
            unclean, self-taught, sharp, and wise.
            Freedom (American myth) -> loneliness/isolation.
            Most successful know this; devoted to the myth.
            Most are crushed by the demands.

SELF-REALIZATION THRU SNACK_____________________________________________________
  Advertising not agent of materialism, but force to disconnect humans from the
  material world.

When did we get so bored?
  Exhibition one year mango salsa, other Greek yogurt, high end pop-corns...
    In future birch water?, freeze dried elk? - mystery and superiority
    an answer to a question.
    Age of specialty: vomitous stream of comfort and nostalgia: gelato spheres from
    liquid nitrogen, square marshmallows, and thousands of hot sauce: chipotle-mango
    Yuppie "Trick-or-trick" - sample quinoa bars...
    Food Temps holding little trays.  Most are proprietors wanting to capitalize
    family recipe, tropical fruit found in Peace Corps, mini avocados;
    white mid-westerners - like the 1950's, live dinosaurs, attend "snack-tivation"
    lecture; "our foal is to fill basket with snack, healthy  and delicious".
    Lectures: is Paleo a "trend" or a "fad", endcap location for maximum impact.
  Live exhibition with: burned taste buds, depleted dopamine, bloated, sweating
  everything off for rest of week.

The condiment that will change your life
  Slawsa started from family recipe - now sold at Walmart

The Long Odds of Even a Slow Failure
  Lucky failures are quick 6 months to a years. Unlucky take longer to fail.

Journey to self
  Specific stores target specific niche - discount, natural...
  Know thyself, thy product, where in the industryMaximum Expansion of Alpines are you.
  Asteroid-meets-dinosaur with Amazon, Big Data, e-commerce up-heave every niche.
  Slawsa "all natural"; no health/gourmet pitches; no alienation via pretension

The buyer meeting
  Buyers look for simple - consistent: self life, production, commodity prices.
  Present why it: deserves shelf space, priced to make money, outsells, outshines.

Merchant-supplier negotiation:
    Subtextual (undelying) conversation - not what it appears to be.
      Like dogs circling each other in the park.
      If you give info you loose something. Do not want to be perceived as giving
      up anything, but you have to to make any sense at all.
    "What type of lead time do you need?" meaning:
      1. acknowledge that he is pushed by corporation for rapid change
      2. give space to decline unless it hits his price
    "What do you see happening in the category?"
      1. find weak brands, allow supplier to pitch on the fly
      2, from total ignorance
    Safeway corporate buyer, asked for samples to every manager in every location.
      Two years later no orders - given that buyers see 50 categories thousands
      of SKUs each in a year.  Buyers are rotated to prevent bribes.
    To sell do not think about food, problem solve on buyer's needs.

The crack, a crack, just crack:
  20K new products in selves each year, 89% fail within 18 months
  Buyer looks at UPSPW (units per store per week), total sales, gross profit.
  Interested in "passion"(GMOs) even if detached (environmentalism left).
  To improve sales: 1. replace SKUs 2. change mix  3. ask for supplier efficiency
  4. get payment from supplier (most common) - "TRADE SPEND"; "pay-to-play";
    "slotting-fee" $9 billion/year
    $55K/month for 22x12 shelve space
  Alternatives: "promotion fees" (subsidizing 2-for-1)
                "free-fill" (free case for 100% profit)
                "advertising-fee" (for being in company news letter)
                "radio-network"(advertise in-store speakers)
                "charge back" - pay cost of getting back non-selling product
                waste, spoilage, not-selling payments
                for custom bar-codes, package design
  Cosco is not paying the demos - it demands them - supplier bleeding.
  Stupid deal: put on top shelf, wrong section, and in 6 months pulled out...
    they cynically exploit desperation to get on shelf
    76 billion per year - number 2 cost, after materials
    "if you make money we ask for a piece of it"
  With more venture capital will loose most creative entrepreneurs
  Legislative pigeon shit: random day Nov. 1 is: author, vinegar... national day
  Retailers more powerful than manufactures - will ask producers of national
  brand to do store-labeled product better than national brand.
  Co-packing: outsource food production and focus in marketing.
    8-hour shift once a month to produce 90,000 Slawsa jars.
    Co-packing plant is full of precision and cleanliness - smells make you hungry
    optimize recipe and packaging
    responsible for quality, ingredients
    "local" is 40% minimum, not regulated - based on trust
    buying is international;
    may skip quality checks to get foot in the door
  Slawsa will change our life - sold in Lowes...


THE RETAIL EXPERIENCE___________________________________________________________
  Consumer attitude: 1. life= definable solvable problems
                     2. solving problems is duty
                     3. for every known problem there is solution: object or recipe
                        prepared by specialist - task is to find it.

Health is wealth
  Whole food mission/philosophy 12 hour orientation:
    7 difficult customers (challenging guests): 1. angry 2. whiny 3. hysterical
    4.vip 5. chatterbox 6. know-it-all 7. multi-tasker
    cost 6x to find new customer than find new one
    Efficient (make money) and green; about:
      serving yourself you serve humanity
      life which we deserve as intelligent well-intentioned Americans
    Organic is not healthier but willing to pay more
    Body works harder to break down long-named ingredients (linguistic-digestion link)
    Most recycling bin get corrupted and thrown as trash.
    Insulation, light efficiency
    Health for planet, wealth for store
    Low skill job to create myth of abundance for high wage people
  Fish counter is mortuary - time, heat, oxygen are enemies
  Working retail: people are hideous and insane
  Forced to be nice to people is nice - nasty managers, low pay, gossip...no nice
  We as customers are oppressing the smilers;
  grocery experience feels too good to be true.
  "Human Capital Management" or "just-in-time scheduling" or "lean supply" -
  the promise of computing and big data grind down human resources

The grind
  "Human Capital Management"... are from 1950's Japanese car manufacturing
  Expansion from that to human resource shows our "efficiency drunkenness" and
  loopy moral compass.
  Car manufacture:
    600 stations installing one ten thousand parts
    1020's a car every 24 seconds
    Need precision repeated million times per day.
      Too few parts line stops, too many factory over burdened.
      American solution:
        Extra space and parts, and simple/homogenized;
        Ford's rouge river plant: 6 million sq feet, vertical integration;
                                  ore and coal to produce iron
      Japanese solution: extra space and parts, and simple/homogenized;
        No space no resources
        Toyota- modernize wooden loom with gasoline engines, then car engines
          Taiichi Ohno in US in 1956's stunned by the abundance in supermarket
            like the Italian women in supermarket.
            Instead of food he saw process - restocking shelves -> "auto parts
            will be available in the time they were needed"
        "just-in-time" solution matured after 20 years;
          tighter and more flexible supply chain
          communication/collaboration over conformity
          obsessive about waist
          kanban cards
          Toyota margins grew to 8x industry average
  "just-in-time" (inventory management) made its way to retail slowly
  Last 10 years: "just-in-time" manufacturing -> "just-in-time" scheduling
    efficiency squats on face of worker
    "optimized schedule base on customer demand"
    "variable scheduling"
    "advance labor forecasting"
  Sinister (evil): apply the management of auto parts to human beings.
  Variable schedule:
    1. push people into part time
    2. destroy ability for second job
    3. promise benefits and hold them
  Workers hours varied 50% from month to month.
  30% get less than 24 hour notice for schedule change.
    Non-consumer facing workers:
      Not a hyperbole there is concerted effort to turn low-wage warehouse
      workers to living cyborgs leveraging fined-tuned muscle control with
      immediate feedback and surveillance of computer systems.
      Amazon patented haptic (touch) wristband that can tract itch scratching.
      Haptic feedback can be biochemical via nootropics (cafeine, gink)
  "On call" doctors are compensated and get civic respect
  "just-in-time" seen as progress; literal dehumanization is "valuable for team"
  In Whole Foods: "just-in-time" not mentioned, but schedule change were mentioned
      as "efficiency", "team play", "smart decision making".
      Coercion to be "team player" or asked to play in different team, Walmart..
      They bring up lateness, safety logs which do not matter but they matter
      as soon as you complain.

Which bleeds into a larger question
  Whole Food's myth of abundance and efficiency is based on having workers spend
  6 years with $15/hour and remain cheerful serving those who pay.
  Although $1 increase in payroll gives $3.81 margin increase, it is assumed that
  efficiency good working capacity can be trained in others fopr less than the time
  efficiency to retrain a good worker.
  The larger question: is efficiency race to bottom?
    Is there efficiency and beating rivals possible with dignity?

BACKSTAGE IN THE THEATER OF RETAIL______________________________________________

Introduction
  Understand how space subconsciously triggers behavior --> use it to create joy.
  Psychology/architecture/ethnographics/interior design-->create space-->fuel sales.
  Sell Harley in a warehouse not showrooms - listen to (not manipulate) Harley man.
  Between moving and cynical.

Deluded that was a distraction
  Simony: rich pay to be released of sins
  Grocery store: buy organic for salvation; poor harm the earth and their children.
  Understanding architecture is distraction; ethical labeling more important...

Vendors of integrity
  Ethics are privatized.
  4.5%/0.001% of domestic/imported foods are inspected for fraud & mislabeling
  50%/70% of fruits/seafood is imported
  Voluntary fee-for-service government seafood inspection --> 40% fraud
  Regulation failure --> tort lawyers; 1993 Jack in the Box E.coli...
    Sweatshops; corporate PR, empowered consumer --> social audit
    2020 $50 billion/year audit industry
    Private auditing is 10X larger than government inspections

Mildly Untrained, Mildly Invasive
  Auditor: more willing-to-travel than highly-trained-expert
  A chicken expert doing lettuce audit and finding what he did not know.
  Issuers of food safety/quality/environmental impact are electric light bulb experts
  Mildly untrained/inexperienced/invasive/outsourced auditors becoming new norm.
  For safety weak-regulation/strong-tort-work/private-audit is working:
    In 1999 500,000 lbs recalled per month - now none.
  Audits are scheduled, planned, and scripted - no penalties or persecutions.
  Overt fraud in desperate, small, family... facilities:
    1. Software to keep multiple sets of records
    2. Buy guidebook for best way to conceal factory
    3. Issue bribe
  Options: 1. shop for auditor that gives results - not to blow deals
           2. do overt fraud (secondary)

Back to architecture
  How a social audits used? how is fraud/quality risk handled?
   --> become best friends with Quality Assurance officer, get drunk with him,
       and ask him (this is academic advice)
  Audits are hazy, and ethics are important --> audit the auditors.
    Food safety more empirical than food ethics, but from auditor:
      "I wouldn't wipe my ass with a food audit"
    "You want to talk about fraud? 25,00 chickens have a little door that no
    chicken sticks its head out - chickens sold for 3x price - tell how that
    is not fraud"
  (2015 H5N2 flu, 43 million chickens destroyed in 60 days)
  35 days for chicken to mature, ceiling raised 6 inches to accommodate shit.
    Shit gives off ammonia and workers use corn starch to protect their skin.
    Except for the smell, place is clean.
  Visit to pig farm with Animal rights group:  mostly healthy pigs
    few have tumors & wounds...expected in large group

Caked in odor of pig shit
  Architect consultant: retailers ask for bliss points after they have sucked the
  soul out of their business, have no imagination, imagine only of being Walmart.
  Realm building: experience is sum of interactions, outside...
   retail should orient emotions like a movie - movies are manipulative; retail
   should move us - unless you care only about money.

Buying into meaning
  We buy food to taste and to demonstrate taste; like
  all-American consumption attached to our sense of self.
  Anthropologist:most people do know if they like something until they share it.
  Taste (consumption):
    1. freedom to express unique self
    2. require communal approval
  All consumer goods carry meaning.
  Food used to be about wealth and social standing.
  Now food is used:  for self-definition - organic, TV shows....
                     to define relationship to our bodies, to natural world
                     to resolve consumption tensions
  "Displaced ideals": our highest ideals which we remove from daily reality
                      and to preserve/protect them we placed on something else -
                      George Washington, Beethoven...
                      We use material possessions to provide a bridge back to them.
  Food (and consumer goods) is perfect space for "displaced ideals".
  Dark side: store provides new foods and we cannot decide when are true self
             jumps out.
  Retail is giant reflection of society - what people think, want, and look for.
  We are meaning seeking species & place meaning in consumption.
  Architect (with anthropologists) tries to create meaning not to make more money
    but something that retailers & consumers can feel proud.
    Customers: "I want a store which I do not have to apologize for"
               "We could not run a more impersonal store even if we tried"
    Get a story from interviews - what they like - and make it physical.
    Easiest to work we founders, if not work with customers.
    Harley customers cannot read/express emotions; can be validated by danger.
    User barns and symbols of danger.
  What 'activates' us:
    Concerned about audits - want to use purchase to create better world.
    Want reassurance that glut of pleasure and variety is not unfair bounty but
    opportunity to give back via organic, ethical, fair label seals.
    Third party audit/certification solves a problem inside us.
      Allow us to buy by promising sense of control and destiny
    Real audits are faulty , expensive, non-enforceable, anti-ethical...
      for few pennies get sense of virtue
      "displaced ideal" kept at distance (do not examine audits) to be preserved.
    Certifications
      Conspiracy of good intentions: we do not have to do anything; replace
      terror of the world with felling of control.
      We need & do trust 15,000 suppliers even though
      we are flying with no instruments.
  Buddhist monk "our life has to be message"
    We may use objects, but primary is how we chose to live, treat/care others.
    Certifications allows us to buy ideals without enacting them via unions,
    labor laws....
  Humans need to connect - to do it on price alone we need to lower ourselves.

BOTTOM OF THE COMMODITY CHAIN___________________________________________________

Swallow little fish - something big you cannot see a piece of it
  Andaman sea - off Myanmar - benthic (bottom) trawl - maw (mouth) of destruction.
    Slaves, indentured servants, free men, sort through sludge of fish;
    work in treat of violence - some are killed,
    to sleep 4 hours/night crawl 12 feet in 1 meter tall compartment.
  16-60% of shrimp  include slave labor; Thailand 10% of global shrimp supply;
  50% goes to US - where shrimp is most popular seafood.
  Fish transferred to other boat, rotten fish sludge get cooked into fish meal
  500K shrimp larvae in tubs - work 24 hours, paid by survivability
  of tank that they manage
  Rule #1 do not hire locals - hire Burmese (Myanmar).
  Day 25 - shrimp size of grain of rice - girls count them and put them in
  plastic bags with oxygen & send to hatchery.
  Quality control - in microscope gut/muscle ratio, size distribution.
  Post-larvae shrimp (90/square meter) in hatchery:
    Miles of dead hatchery tanks - did not know how to do it.
    Fed 5 times a day fish meal, for 3 months.
    Black waste on tank bottom - for harvest transferred to clean water tanks.
  Live shrimp and crushed ice put in same barrels as the fish slurry.
    10 hours to freeze them -30F for export
    Each hour reduces weeks or months of shelf life.
    At supermarket after 6 months start to end.
  Peeling and beheading in illegal "peeling sheds" by migrant families.
    Out of one "peeling shed" in 40 US brands.
    Peeling cannot be automated.
  Large processors sell to exporters - can pressure brokers for more.
    Brokers pressure "peeling sheds"
    They have cleanest facilities for bagging - to enter must disinfect with PPE.
    Shrimp sliced by hand every 2 seconds.
    Boiled and frozen in 13 minutes.
    Name and logo added to bag after they are bought.

Huddling and bundling
  Commodities (iron, wheat, gold, swine...) are fungible (to serve in place of):
    identical for practical purposes - shares, options; land, diamond not fungible
    From convenient; product with many details and scrutiny to facilitate trade.
    trash fish become protein.
    Trade off: reduce visibility (out of sight out of mind).
      Thicket in ground --> corporate flowchart via marketing...
      scattered springs become "Poland spring"
    Abstraction and filtering of reality.

Simplification of Eyestalk (eye socket)
  Fresh shrimp 30 years ago were luxury- cost more than steak.
    caught from middle of water column; 5 pounds of other fish and turtles
    for 1 pound of shrimp.
    Expensive boats and labor limited supply.
  Since 1980 price fell and 30x production increase
    Breakthrough:
      Shrimp raised in tidal pools not successful/
      Shrimp going around tanks loose one eye.
      Female with lost eye ovulates in 3 days.
      Farmer reproduced this by removing one eye.
    Bred for fleshy tails, odd diet.. --> economic fairy tail
    Pink gold = 4x rice profit.
    2 lbs fish = 1 lb shrimp
      10x fish trawling; trash fish became industry
      new boat: trash fish boat
    Disease: all shrimp in pond may die all at once: toxic stew.
      Local booms to bust from Vietnam to India
      Global is continuous growth
      New disease mutate - farming not insurable
      gamble on lack of ecological collapse

Able-bodied man
  Burmese from small village crosses river to Thailand.
    Broker waiting for him, takes to a house with 100 migrants.
    Migrants walk 210 mile through mountains 6 die along way.
    1 can of sardines shared by 4.
    25 in a truck fro 12 hours - defecate and pee inside.
    A woman died in the truck.
    After a car ride, locked with 25 men in a room with a toilet.
    Fed 2x/day for 1 weeks.
    Told will work for 3 months for smuggling expense, other 3 will be paid.
    Throws up 1st 3 days on boat, get sick, goes to sleep
    captain beats with steel yo-yo - he owns him.
    His teen age friend gets sick, sleeps in captain's bed, refuses to work,
    beaten and kicked into the sea.
    Boat goes to non-Thai port every 4 months.
    Escapes hide in jungle and die of starvation eating stray dogs.
    After 5 years with no pay asks to leave and is let go.
    Works for 2 months for man who locks him at night and charges rent.
    Goes out to sea again, looses fingers, has hand ambulated.
    Becomes whistle blower in Indonesia, sent to Thailand, sponsored by Thai
    NGO LPN, government labels a victim; feels very lucky.

Replacement theory of migrants
  Perfect storm:
    1. 1989 typhoon sinks hundreds of Thai boats --> afraid fishermen
       and aquacultures starting ---> massive labor shortage.
       Overfishing --> deep water fishing --> transshipment at sea
       (boats stay out for a year)
    2. Globalization
    3. Poverty - migrants waiting in border
    4. Racism - Burmese are darker; Thais say: "danger to public order, high
       birth rates, disease and crime.."
    5. Corrupt Thai police sell prisoners to labor broker
  Boat owner pays salaries up front. Broker risks jails dodging police. Migrants
  are promised but enslaved.
  Migrant's obligation is restraint from leaving.
  Buyer competes for customers. Supplier cannot compete paying living wages.
  Know polluting aquaculture and exploited migrants but with fungibility
  of commodity goods, stay in denial how system works.
  American retails extort: get certification or we will not buy.
  Supplier no control over equipment cost but control in labor cost.

Most unusual of Thai slavery is that you are hearing about it
  LPN (labor protection network) started by P'Aon and Sompong helping migrant
  children, got trust of parents.
  P'Aon, a short woman, rescued 2,000 migrants
    Beriberi (B-1; thiamine deficiency) caused bu eating raw fish.
    Uncovered industry with slavery which continues

Shrimp, chocolate, coffee, cattle, cotton, timber, sugar, palm oil, tungsten, gold
  have forced labor
  35 million are coerced to work- their labor worth $150 billion
  sex slaves < 1/4
  Shrimp slavery uncovered by billionaire Omidyar (ebay)
  2013 Guardian publish expose - Bangkok fills with white reporters looking for
  sea food slaves.
  Shrimp suppliers: Thailand is not unique
                    Forced labor is globally necessary
                    Boats are only extreme in the violence - farms have
                    same exploitation.
                    Production shifted in India.
  Moral fantasy: raise prizes.
  Whole foods claimed without knowing that their shrimp were from forced labor.
  Retailer switch suppliers to cater to aesthetic sense of consumers.
  Media storm --> boycott --> forced labor displaced & more underground.
    Alternative: Find why are people poor and fix it.

This is how she does it.
  P'Aon in camp wakes at 5:30, by 7:30 arrive at abandoned rural school.
  Clean and by 8:30 room is 3/4 full - local kids and parents.
  Linked and informed connected by what we give instead of what we get.

THE LONG ROAD FROM P'AON TO AMAZON_WHOLE FOODS__________________________________
________________________________________________________________________________
  JANA activist investors - got Apple to show screen time in iOS - bought Whole
  Food share before it was bought by Amazon.
  Errol Schweiser began in retail floor, and now in board or national retailers
    advises suppliers -"asset in innovation culture and asshole in maintenance"
    Knows 80 hour week in retail floor and 80 hours in boardroom.
    Jewish "Tikkun Olam": repair the world by kindness.
    Outraged at private equity (not listed in stock exchange):
      value(except treating people well) = price
    Sourcing chocolate without slave labor is agonizingly difficult.
    See the world and  be create how you engage with it.
    Got out of Whole Foods after Amazon takeover.
      Whole Foods before Amazon:
        From 60's counter culture.
        Texas libertarian - government corrupt/failed to regulate agriculture.
        "Conscious capitalist": save Mother Nature and delight Wall Street.
        Decentralized: wages, suppliers...
      Whole Foods after Amazon:
        Dropped the "conscious" part of capitalism.
        Big and centralized, compete on price and convenience.
        By 2016 all idealists/activists left.
        Home depot/Target/Walmart guys came in.
        Be cheapest with employees and suppliers paying for it.
        Cut medical benefits to workers - "to create equitable scheduling""
    NGOs talk of people/planet/profit;
      good job on maximizing profit; to protect planet comes at expense of people.
    Errol Schweiser: Question is "do you want race to bottom?"
      "Chasing price downhill rewards the worst practice"
      Problem is finance community.

Two paths
  Trader's job paths:
    1. create "discontinuous" products which cannot be imitated
    2. grow big and cut costs
    buy for customer instead of setting to customer
  Amazon:
    Maximize efficiency, minimize price, be convenient.
    Free people to make the best of their time.
  Yoga helped people, bankers/lawyers.., be more capable;
    their better version did not help others
  Convenience/efficiency for delivery are end points.
    what then?
  We are caught between nature everlasting and our new tools (mono-cultures,
    pesticides, ...).
    To survive between them, we give up aspects of our lives -
    community, duty, eccentricity, care....
    Grocery re-calibrates on part of ourselves we want trade.
  The closer we look at food the more disgusting it is.
  We got the food system we deserve.
  Not "we are what we eat", but "we eat the way we are";
    Supply chain responds to our actions and demands of convenience and efficiency,
    Solution is outside the food system - food is a distraction.

Climbing out to fresh air
  Trucker: "I am going broke and do not know what to do", has nothing to say
    about Google's Waymo (has driver-less truck and taxi service.)
  Thailand junta threatened by media crisis created new paperwork,
    to eliminate slavery will take 15+ years
  Former slave, after 20 years in Thailand, compensated not for slavery but
    for losing arm, will move back to his village to start a grocery chain.
