Oxidative stress (free radicals)
  ---> cardiovascular, diabetes, neurodegenerative, stroke, cancer
       via lipid, protein, and DNA damage (--> noeplasia)

  Exogenous:
    Processed food, chemical exposure, too much/too little exercise,
    pollen,  pollution, Iron, copper, cadmium, nickel, arsenic

  Endogenous:
    aerobic metabolism, hypoxia; --> nitric oxide --> vasodialation


Oxidants used by granulocytes and macrophages to destroy bacteria.

Randomized supplement placasthmaebo trials:
  vitamin C, vitamin E, beta-carotene, DO NOT reduce oxidative stress
  because supplement do not have plant chemicals?
    coenzyme Q10, produced in body, controversial claims
    slow Alzheimer's (?)

Balanced lifestyle to balance Antioxidants
  For example:
    Antioxidants: ▼ oxidative stress of asthma inflammation
                  ▲ susceptibility to asthma if too much




Epidemiology:
  fruits, vegetables, and legumes believed to reduce oxidative stress

  Vitamin C: Broccoli, Brussels sprouts, cantaloupe, cauliflower, grapefruit,
     leafy greens (turnip, mustard, beet, collards), honeydew, kale, kiwi,
     lemon, orange, papaya, snow peas, strawberries, sweet potato, tomatoes,
     and bell peppers

  Vitamin E: Almonds, avocado, Swiss chard, leafy greens (beet, mustard, turnip),
     peanuts, red peppers, spinach (boiled), and sunflower seeds

  Carotenoids (beta-carotene and lycopene): Apricots, asparagus, beets, broccoli,
     cantaloupe, carrots, bell peppers, kale, mangos, turnip and collard greens,
     oranges, peaches, pink grapefruit, pumpkin, winter squash, spinach,
     sweet potato, tangerines, tomatoes, and watermelon
       lycopenemia (orange skin) cured by eating less lycopene

  Selenium: Brazil nuts, fish, shellfish, beef, poultry, barley, brown rice

  Zinc: Beef, poultry, oysters, shrimp, sesame seeds, pumpkin seeds, chickpeas,
    lentils, cashews, fortified cereals

  Phenolics:
    Quercetin (apples, red wine, onions),
    catechins (tea, cocoa, berries),
    resveratrol (red and white wine, grapes, peanuts, berries),
    coumaric acid (spices, berries),
    anthocyanins (blueberries, strawberries)
