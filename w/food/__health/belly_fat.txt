Visceral (abdominal) fat (apple shaped) is inside belly between  organs.
  near portal vein (carries blood from intestines to liver)
  release fatty acids which enter portal vein -& effect LDL and HDL cholesterol
  Linked to type 2 diabetes & cardiovascular disease,
    for women: breast cancer and gallbladder surgery.
      gallbladder: stores bile from liver on right, under stomach
        help digest fat/vitamins, galls stones as large as golf ball
          stones: cholesterol, or bilirubin (old red blood cells)

  Visceral fat cells - like a gland, produce hormones (estrogen) &
    cytokines (immune chemicals):
       tumor necrosis factor - produced by white cells - kills tumor cells
       interleukin-6 - produced by T-cells & activated by adipose (fat)

  Versus subcutaneous fat (pear shaped) is skin fat you can pinch;
    not as concerning as visceral

  Reduction: diet & exercise/active.
    exercise:
      10 MET-hours/week aerobic exercise
        typing:          1.5 MET
        sweeping:        3
        bicycling-10MPH: 6
        rope-jump:       10
          MET: Mmetabolic equivalent;
               1 MET = standing still
      Sit-ups strengthen abdominal muscles - do nothing to visceral fat.
