Bacteria
  spherical, straight rods, and spiral rods
  doubling may occur as frequently as every 15 minutes,
  1 to 1 billion in 5 hours
  Most sporulating aerobic bacteria are Genus Bacillus,
  Most anerobic are Genus Clostridium.
  do not like low pH, moisture, or temperature and high salt/sugar

Yeasts and Molds
  reproduce most often by budding

  Molds as found on bread, fruit, damp paper,
  millions of microscopic cells joined together to form chains
  chains usually have numerous branches, called hyphae
  conditions too adverse for bacteria or yeasts
  reproduce by spores; frequently as green or black masses on the protruding hyphae
  grow on most foods, on equipment, and building surfaces where there are small a
  mounts of nutrient and moisture.
  Since bacteria grow faster, they greatly outnumber yeasts and molds in most foods.
  do not mind low pH, moisture, or temperature and high salt or sugar unfavorable
  problem in dry foods, salted fish, bread, pickles, fruits, jams, jellies

Virus
  parasitic
  infect one species, or related species
  zoonotis, can infect human beings
    (bacterium, virus, parasite or prion) that has jumped from an animal
  Food importance:
    bacteriophage of lactic or other fermentative bacteria.
      production of cheese, buttermilk, sauerkraut, pickles, wine, beer
    cannot multiply in foods
    infectious for long time; after  drying, freezing, and pasteurization

Temperature
  Molds: 14°F+
  Psychrophies grow only at refrigeration temperatures.
  Psychrotrophs (41F to 90F), faster than mesophiles,
                spoilage & interfere with mesophiles)
                grow in refrigerator, best at room temperature below 90F
  Mesophiles (most food borne disease 40F to 140F)
              grow best at or near human body temperature,
              grow well at room temperature.
  Thermophiles grow only as hot as the human hand can endure,
               not at all at or below body temperature.

  41°F to 32°F doubles shelf life
  41°F to 135°F bacteria grow fastest

  Pasteurization, (yeasts, molds, and bacteria),  140°F/161°F for 30 min./16 sec.
  Canned foods 240°F to 250°F for 1 hour or more.
  Microbiologists sterilize at 250°F (121C) for 15 or 20 min.
  Contaminants in dry foods hard to kill with heat;
    wet/dry egg albumen at 140°F (60C) for 3.5 min/several days
  At 120°C, survive spores ~ 100,000*exp(t[min]/3); half-life = 3*ln(1/2) = 2.1 min
  Freezing: kills Clostridium perfringens, but not its spores, other bacteria survive.

Water Activity
   (aw)  availability of water to microorganisms
   Pure water has an aw of 1.00, equilibrium relative humidity (ERH) of 100%
   ounce of rocks to a quart of water: ERH will fall to about 98 % and the aw to 0.98

  Minimum water activity (aw) limits
    Salmonella              0.945
    Clostridium botulinum   0.95
    Clostridium perfringens 0.93
    Staphylococcus aureus   0.86, 0.93 for toxin production
    Vibrio parahaemolyticus 0.94

  Some molds can grow very slow in foods with aw 0.62 – 0.65
  Fully dried foods, such as crackers or sugar aw=0.10
     microbiologically stable
  Stability dried fruits, jams depends (aw 0.75 – 0.90) depends on low aw,
    low pH, pasteurization, chemical additives, and impervious packaging.

pH
  concentration of the hydrogen ion; 1 and 10−14 gram-equivalents per liter
  pH 5 there are 10 times as many H + as at pH 6
  Most bacteria grow best at about pH 7 and grow poorly or not at all below pH 4.
  Yeasts and molds, therefore, predominate in low pH foods
  lactic acid bacteria are exceptions

    (100 billion/gram)
    in raw meats, milk, and eggs; naturally in soil, water, and plants
    not fetal, indicate health risk
    metabolize lactose, produce acid and gas
    Escherichia coli most common: salt/fresh water limits: 600/500 per 100 ml

Food-borne infections:
  Top 5:
    1. Norovirus (Norwalk Ohio virus)
      Reservoirs: contaminated water: leafy greens, fruits, shellfish, handled food
      highly contagious; tiny vomit/feces particles, surfaces, sharing food
      in Boston infected person continued working --> 141 person sickened
      vomit, diarrhea, stomach 1/2 to 2 days after ingestion
      protected a few months after exposure
      no concern in food industry
      Japanese wanted Norwalkvirus name because Noro is a last name

    2. Salmonella (genus) (Salmon, veterinary pathologist):
      Salmonella enterocolitis (intestine colon) - most food poisoning
        Reservoir: domestic/wild animals & humans
      Salmonella Typhi (ethereal cloud causing madness)- causes typhoid fever

      catch it from raw/under-cooked poultry; causes  campylobacteriosis
      1st worldwide to cause gastroenteritis (stomach/intestine; vommit, diarrea)
      gram-negative - Azithromycin
      dies rapidly in ambient temperature/atmosphere, and grows poorly in food.

    5. Staphylococcus aureus (Grapes-berry golden) / "staph":

      Food poisoning strains generally come from humans
        MRSA (Methicillin-Resistant Staphylococcus aureus) - no risk getting from food
          eradicated with whole body wash and nasal ointment
      Heat destroys it, but not its toxin
      100,000/gram when bacteria allowed to grow in food
      Food free from staph is difficult or impossible
        1. reduce exposure of cooked foods - use gloves or clean hands
        2. eliminate raw materials with high bacteria counts
        3. process to destroy bacteria
        4. eliminate raw --> cooked food contamination
        5. keep food less than 2-4 hours between 40°F and 140°F
      In fermented foods, cheese or sausages, to inhibit toxin formation:
        low pH, high levels of lactic bacteria, salt, and nitrite
      gram-positive, no spores; penicillin, methicillin

  Not as many but lead to hospitalization:

  Gram-negative bacteria have outer membrane; harder for antibiotics to work.

Mycotoxins
  100,000 turkeys died after eating moldy peanut meal
  Ergot, typically in cereal grains, in bread it forms hallucinogenic drugs
    black wheat grains
    contains ergotamine, makes: lysergic acid and then LSD
    Russians died during World War II from eating moldy grains.
    Japanese died from eating moldy rice
    Aflatoxins at very low levels can produce liver cancer
      (from Aspergillus flavus [holy water sprinkler, yellow] fungus
       optimum temp. 98F, temp. range 54-118 F)
      FDA limit 0.5/20/100 ppb limit in milk/food/feed
      may be produced without visible mold growth
      in damaged corn, figs, grain sorghum, cottonseed, peanuts, and tree nuts.
      Use high intensity ultraviolet  to detect it in corn
      no antidote, lethal via liver damage
        cooking destroys 50%, pressure cooking 70%
    produced in grains, dry beans and fruits, spices, nuts, and cured meats.
    Demeter and Persephone Eleusinian Mysteries cult:
       drink barley drink, Kykeon, for great revelations.
    Eliminate conditions that permit mold;
      Insect and bird damaged corn kernels are very susceptible
      Control storage and initial drying

Spoilage prevention
  Use bacteria, yeasts, or molds that are not hazardous to health.
  Chill to slow spoilage;
  Freeze, dry, can, and pickle to stops it

  Refrigerated Foods
    33°F is optimum, but around 45°F most common
    Psychrotrophs: Yersinia enterocolitica, Listeria monocytogenes, C. botulinum, some E. coli and Aeromonas hydrophilia.
    Above 41°F: Vibrio parahemolyticus; Bacillus cereus; Staphylococcus aureus, some Salmonella.
    Temperature abuse during food storage and distribution.
    Treatments:  heat, acidification, preservatives, reduced water activity
       Modified atmosphere enhances product quality not safety
    Example of multiple barrier principle: pasteurized cheese:
      reduced water activity (added salt and phosphates)
      mild heat to eliminate/inhibit non-spore/spore forming pathogens.
      keep good seams on cans

  Canned Goods
    Reduce the spore level in the food
    cool heat processed containers quickly

  Dry Foods
    heat, dry, or add sugar/salt
    molds have lowest water tolerance

  Fermented and Pickled Foods
    Stable because of organic acids from lactic bacteria
    Fermentation stops if:
      bacteriophage attack starter culture
      inadequate temperature  or fermentable carbohydrate
    Prevent fermentation spoilage:
      1. keep starter in pure culture (one yeast) to eliminate bacteriophage
      2. Add fermentable carbohydrate or organic acid
      3. Salt to inhibit bad bacteria and help salt-tolerant lactics
      4. Use lactics favored temperature
    Prevent spoilage of fermented or picked food:
      1. add benzoates, sorbates, or propionates
      2. pasteurize
      3. store pickles with brine to inhibit molds & yeast
