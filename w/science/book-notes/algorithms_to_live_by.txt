INTRODUCTION
  Optimal stopping problems: how to find best apartment, parking, mate,...
    how to reduce the Scylla-and-Charybdis ("choose the lesser of two evils")
      (six-headed sea monster and whirlpool in Messina strait)
      finding best versus getting nothing
      looking / leaping balance; balance is NOT defined
    solution:
      37%; 100 days available, look for 37 days, and commit on 1st like after
      Suitor does need therapist but algorithm
  Finite space & time --> problems:
    what to do, leave undone, how much to embrace
  How computer processor allocate attention? - be faster with minimum overhead

    wrote: fī ḥisāb al-jabr waʾl-muqābala
           'The Compendious Book on Calculation by Completion and Balancing'
    algebra: al-jabr: "completion" --> algorithm
  Oldest algorithm: 4K year Sumerian long division on clay
  Common algorithms: bake bread, start fire,... technology

  Human algorithm: solutions to everyday problems
    1. 'optimal stopping' - look and leap
    2. 'explore/exploit' - try new things/enjoy favorites
    3. 'sorting theory' - how and whether to arrange offices
    4. 'caching theory' - how to fill closets
    5. 'scheduling theory' - how to fill time

  Science: more on how to think than what to know
  Computer science: 1. nature of human mind
                    2. meaning of rationality
                    3. how to live
  Use chance, time/accuracy trade off, approximate
  Behavioral economics: Humans are irrational & error prone because of buggy brain
  Counter intuitive solutions:
    do not consider all options
    do go for outcome that seems best every time
    make mess on occasion
    travel light
    let things wait
    trust instinct and not think long
    relax
    toss coin
    forgive do not forget
    to thine own self be true
  How to find spouse or sort socks
  Manage time, space,attention, unknowns, information, future with grace/confidence
    --> New vocabulary for the world.

1. OPTIMAL STOPPING
  Turkey drop: high school sweethearts break up after freshman year Thanksgiving
  "Secretary problem" --> 37% (1/e) rule
    How to hire secretary - 1960 puzzle - solved in 1950s by Merrill Flood
    2 applicants 50% no matter what
    3 applicants 33% if random; 123 132 213 231 312 321 (6) 1 is best
      33% look --> look at one
      213 231 312; 50% if after 1st
      123 132; 33% of dismissing best;
      321; 16% of never meeting best
      n/stop/chance for best:  (stop: take best applicant after)
        3  1 50%
        4  1 46%
        5  2 43%
        10 3 40%
        20 11 38%
        100 37 37%
      Date 1 girl per year, from 18 to 40
      Look until 16 & leap after that - maybe be rejected....
   Kepler widow at 40, courted 11 women, picked #5 & had 6 children
   If rejected half the time,  look 61%, leap on remaining 39%
   Look at at all go back to best - chances for best 61%
   "Secretary with know percentile rank"; "no-information game" --> "full information"
      Threshold rule - 58% of getting best
      n to last / h percintile threshold of stop
      2 /50 th
      3 /69 th
      4 /78th
   "Selling house" - expect offer 400K - 500K
     offer (waiting) cost/ acceptable offer
     $1  $499,553
     $2K $480K
     $50K any offer
     how people look for jobs; unemplyed workers/unfilled vacancies
   "parking car": balance price, time walking, time searching, gas, passenger count
     Price should be adjusted to have 85% occupancy.
     90% --> 95% occupancy accomodates 5% more cars but doubles the search time
     Infinite long road:
       occupancy rate/wait this many spaces then take next free spot
       0 0
       50 1
       75 3
       80 4
       85 5
       99 69
   "when to quit" - "the burglar problem"
      for novice 50/50 caught/succed, stop after 1 (50/50)
      for pro 10%/90%: stop after 9 (90/10)
    for 50/50 winning chance - triple or nothing bet there is no optimum stopping
      avoidnace is best
    natural tendency to stop early - 31% instead of 37% for the secretary
                                     4/5 of times leaped sooner (from experiments)
       --> because time costs (of ones life)
    "Optimal stopping problem": choosing time to take action - nature of time itself
                                implicit premise of what is to be alive
                                forces us to embrace high failure when acting optimally
    When clock is ticking, cannot weigh all options, must decide when to stop.


2. EXPLORE / EXPLOIT
  Every day forced to decide: 1. try new things  2. stick with favorite
    Life is balance of novelty/tradition; latest greatest/what we know and love

  Explore/Exploit
    --> gather/use information for good result
      Family gathering, book reading, favorite music is exploitation
      Music journalist: constantly listen to new music - martyr like so others can exploit.

  Size the interval
    "Multi-armed  bandit problem" (MAB) (one armed bandit =slot machine) - a room full
      of slot machines with different odds.
      Choosing restaurant or favorite movie is deciding which arm to pull in casino of life.
      Most rational is not the best.
      Decision is not isolated - depends on how long you are in casino.
      Eat drink for tommorrow we may die.  --> inverse:
        Learn new language, make small talk wiht stanger, life is long no one knows the all joys...
      Intevals make stategy, boserve stategy to find interval:
        Explore when you you will have time to resulting info, exploit when ready; interval is stategy.
        Movie sequels: guaranteed fan base,cash cow, an exploit.
          --> Film industry signals that is near end of itsinterval.
              Profits have actually gone down; they play best slot machines before
              casinos turn them out.
      MAB algorithms for:
       Ads,
       price experiments,
       crowdsourcing,
       search

  Win-stay
   MAB solution: Win-stay, Lose Shift (Stay the winner)
     Consider only two machines, keep playig one when winning,
       use you loose shift to other machine.

  Gittins Index
    Particular gateway to universal
    Gittins, professor of statistics, tried to optimize drug trials;
      multiple options, different reward probabilities/costs.
       COs: R&D new drugs/make current drugs more profitable
       Drs: encourage experimental dugs/prescribe best drugs
         Interval: not clear; idefinite future
           present has higher priority, future is discounted
      Problem: maximize payoff, no interval, for discounted future.
        payoff decreases exponentially
        Visiting for 10 days and choose restaurant --> use interval
           staying indefinite --> no interval
           If 1% chance of being hit by bus, tommorrow dinner is discunted 99%
      Solution strategy: think each arm of multi-arm bandit seprately & use bribe
        similar to Deal or no deal: open suitcases, or listenen to banker not to.
        If offered a guaranttted rate, we can be content never to pull arm;
          rate is Gittins index --> play arm with highest index
          (git when the Gitting is good)
        For next payoff = 90% of current,
          machine with 1-1 win/loss, index =.6346   --> chose this over 6-9
                       6-9                  .6300
                       0-1                  .5001  Small explotation bonus
                       0-0                  .7029  Unknown machine is better than
                                                   is better than machine that pays 70% of time
                                                   (the exploitation bonus)
                                                   rookie worth more then veteran
                      ♾️-♾️                 .5000  convergent value for all payofs
        For next payoff = 99% of current,
          machine with 1-1 win/loss, index =.7844
                       6-9                  .6997
                       0-1                  .7005  larger explotation bonus
                       0-0                  .8699
        The grass is always greener --> because unknown has chance to be better
                                        even when expect to be no different
          but it may not be worth it....

  Regret & optimism
    Gittins Index alternative: regret; things we failed to do;
      "To try and fail is at least to learn, to fail to try is to suffer regret"
      Bezos: decision to start amazon incredibly easy - regret minimization...
        try internet which was going to be really big
    Regret = payoff of a strategy - maximum payoff (using the best slot machine)
      1. Total regret is always increasing
      2. Increase is less if you pick best strategy
         Rate of growth goes down as you learn about problem
      3. Minimum possible regret increases logarithmically;
         Make as many mistakes in 10 pulls as in 100 pulls
         Logarithmic growths: literacy, fitness, weight loss, music skill
    Upper Confidence Bound algorithm: choose for arm with highest possible value
      no one that has performed the best;
      A restaurant with one medium review has more potential than one with may.
      --> Optimism in face of uncertainty
      Meet people & try things assuming the best in absence to the contrary
      Optimism prevents regret

  Bandits Online
    A/B testing: control/variation; slit testing; 2 or more web page versions
      data optimized design
    Obama donate button: Best performer: "Donate and get a gift"
      "Please Donate" worked best for people that never donated
      "Contribute" for previous donors
      After election Optimizely was founded....
      After 10 years not a secret weapon for business/politics
    Amazon/Google A/B testing started on 2000 as part of explore/exploit (users)
      Google tested 41 shades of blue in its toolbar
    Data scientist: "Best minds are thinking how to make people click ads"
      <--> Ginsberg Howl: "Best minds destroyed by madness"
    Explore/exploit algorithm --> colors, buttons, text, images...
       optimized for clicks --> user: not the gambler, but the jackpot.
       --> economic & technological internet power
       Statisticians, engineers , bloggers contest best algorithms.

  Clinical Trials on Trial
    1932-1972 Tuskegee Syphilis Study; Peter Buxtun filed complaint 1966, went public 1972
