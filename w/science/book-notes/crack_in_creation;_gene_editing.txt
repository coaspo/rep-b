    Cutting HIV virus out of infected cells
  Basis of CRISPR: how bacteria defend viral infections
  Someday it may be unethical not to edit erroneous human germline.
    2020:  CRISPRâ€“Cas9 can make unwanted changes at or near the target genome site.

1. QUEST FOR A CURE
  WHIM syndrome (Warts, Hypogammaglobulinemia, Infections, and Myelokathexis)
    few dozen world wide; single letter (dozen atoms) mutation
    --> susceptible to HPV (human papillomavirus);  uncontrollable warts, cancer
  WHIM patient after 40 years seamed cured;
    gene defect in skin cells but not in blood cells, CXCR4 gene, 35M letters, missing
    CXCR4; chemokine receptor type 4; chemokines small chemoattractant protein molecules
    CXCR4 missing, other chromosome 2 letters seemed scrambled
      Cause: single cell chromothripsis - chromosome shatters, repairs, rearranges genes;
        cell may die or cause cancer
        Cell was hematopoietic stem cells - repopulated entire immune system
  Natural gene editing (chromothripsis) cures:
    2 severe combined immunodeficiency (SCID; "bubble boy") cases, SCID kills before age 2
    10%-20% of Wiskott-Aldrich immune syndrome,
    tyrosinemia liver, unable to breakdown tyrosine amino acid
    ichthyosis with ; red flaky skin has mutation, other skin fixed mutation
  Odds of spontaneous gene editing cure is minute.

  Genome: gene/chromosome portmanteau
    DNA deoxyribonucleic acid;  deoxy -sugar backbone one less oxygen than RNA
      4 nucleotides: A,G,C,T other uses:
        purine Adenine - energy storage; A-T
        purine Guanine ("bird/bat droppings")- shampoo, paints, plastics; C-G
        pyrimidine Cytosine - stabilizes DNA;
        pyrimidine Thymine
      Backbone: phosphate group and deoxyribose (sugar)
    RNA A,G,C,U;  U:uracil demethylated thymine
      Backbone: phosphate group and ribose (sugar)
      DNA --> transcription (T-->U ) --> RNA
      3 RNA letters = 1 amino acid
  Central dogma of molecular biology:
    DNA --> replication --> DNA
    DNA --> transcription --> RNA
    RNA --> translation --> protein
  Gene / protein <--> nucleotide / amino acid
               DNA letters,   Genes
      virus    few thousand,  handful
      bacteria millions,      4,000
      fly      100s millions, 14,000
      human    3.2 billion    21,000 roughly same as mouse
      lungfish 130 billion
      plant*   150 billion           * Paris Japonica
  Humans:
    23 chromosome pairs; 50 to 250 million letters each
      Down syndrome: 3 copies of chromosome 21
      23rd pair is XX or XY
    + mini mitochondria chromosome 16,000 letters from mother
  Sickle cell disease:
    17th letter of the beta-goblin mutated from A to T
    glutamate is replaced with valine in hemoglobin
    10 atom change in 80,000 atoms --> stroke, infection, bone pain
    Recessive genetic disease: both copies of HBB (Hemoglobin Subunit Beta) have mutation
  WHIM syndrome:
    one letter in CXCR4 mutate from C to T
    Dominant genetic disease: only one bad copy causes disease
  Huntington's disease (dominant) uncontrolled movement:  defective HHT gene;
    3 DNA letters repeated too many times
  Cystic fibrosis (cells that produce mucus sweat & digestive juice):
    3 letters deleted in cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) gene
  Human genome sequencing: clone large chunks of human DNA in yeast, laboratory automation,
    computational algorithms, $3 billion/2001
    4K mutations identified causing disease
    identify risks
    custom treatments
    $200 to $600 per test
  Attempted gene therapy 1960s via Shope papillomavirus - causes rabbit warts
    for hyperargininemia high plasma arginine and ammonia levels
  Viruses
    Vector virus: transfer gene into cells with near 100% efficiency
    May hide in bacteria chromosomes; HIV retro virus
      8% of human genome (250 million letters) is remnant of ancient retrovirus
    Retooled retroviruses - insert good genes and remove bad ones; 1st attempt 1960s
      first therapy for ADA-SCID (sever combined immunodeficiency) was indeterminate
        improved version Strimvelis 2016 EU approval but stopped at 2020 (leukemia)
        cost 600,000 Euros
      1999 patient died after massive immune response
      2000  5 patients with ADA-SCID treatment died from leukemia
  Gene therapy (adding new gene) does not work in dominant diseases like Huntington's
    Fixing genes is needed: 1. fix RNA or 2. fix DNA

  Instead of using viruses, inject DNA into cells:
    How do mice eggs incorporate injected DNA to next generations?
      Homologous recombination: during formation of of egg and sperm cells - 2 sets
        of chromosomes are pared to 1.  Each pair exchange large chunks of DNA
        ---> diversity;
        Gene-editing: mix DNA with calcium phosphate and mixed with cells:
          some cells replaced old with new DNA; cell tricked to treat re-combatant
          DNA as en extra chromosome that needed to be paired with defective gene
         1980s: created custom mice by editing embryonic stem cells.
  Non-homogeneous of illegitimate recombination:new DNA haphazardly integrated
    by 100:1 to homogeneous - could not use gene-editing
  Damaged DNA can repair itself via homologous recombination of second chromosome copy
    Gene edit by cutting chromosome at damaged gene; cell would search and find the synthetic gene
      I-cel endonuclease from yeast to cut DNA requires match of 18 DNA letters.
        18 letters first added to mouse chromosome - succeed in 10% of the cells
  I-cel could not be modified to target specific sequence
    found dozens of other nucleases - but they only target 6 to 8 letters
    8-letter sequence can occur hundred of times in human genome
  1996 Chandrasegaran created chimeric nuclease by mixing section of natural nucleases
    FokI (breaks any where) + zinc finder proteins (ZFN; matches 3-letter DNA)
  2000s: ZFNs used in human, corn, tobacco, thale cress (small genome)
    not adopted - ZFNs very expensive to make; not consistent - cut too much or not at all..
  2009 TALE (transcripion activator-like effectors) proteins in Xanthomonas
    (plant -infecting bacterium) - similar to ZFNs
    eahc ZFN finger bind to 3 letters, each TALE bind to one
    But TALE nucleases (TALENs)supplanted by CRISPR

2. NEW DEFENSE
   ribozymes (RNA enzyme catalyst- RNA both genetic & catlyst)
     viriod: strand of cirular ribozymes < 30 letters
       self-cleavages & replicates
     designed ribozymes as specific catalysts
     self-splicing ribozymes suggest life arose from RNA molecules
   Therapies: 1. gene therapy - add healthy genes
              2. gene editing - replace defective gene
              3. ribozymes - fix defective RNA - no clinical trial was effective
   CRISPR: ===Clustered Regularly Inter-spaced Short Palindromic Repeats===
     region of bacterial DNA
       Bacteria get snippets of virus DNA from invading use them to create DNA
       segments - CRISPR arrays to "remember" the viruses,
       The bacteria produce RNA from CRISPR arrays to target viruses
       They use Cas9 or a similar enzyme to cut the DNA apart and kill viruses.
       Palidrome - word/phrase that read same backwards;
       Mr. Owl ate my metal worm; complement of ACCTAGGT is TGGATCCA
   CRISPRs in half bacteria & nearly all archaea -
     most widely shared repeating DNA sequence in prokaryots
     CRISPR spacers: matching DNA of bacteria viruses
     More matches less chance for viral infection
     Interspaced sequences mathedviral DN sequences;
       --> part of bacterial/archaea immune system to fight viruses
  1917 d'Herelle Canadian doctor; dysentery in WWI from Shigella (related to Escherichia coli)
    discovered bacteriophages or phages
    Phage therapy in Georgia 20% of infections - Soviet production of tons of phages
    Forgotten in west after antibiotics in 1030s 1940s
    Phages:
     1. Proved genetic code in triples(codons)- 1 triplet = 1 amino acid
        20 not 64 (4^3=64) amino acids because: some are coded by different
          codons; 3 are stop codons (end of protein)
        Lederberg's bacterial conjugation - bacteria mating.  Viruses getting
          foreign genes into infected cells  --> 1st attempt for gene therapy
      2. How genes turn on/off: 1. transcription factor protein
         2. epigenetic- environment via DNA methylation (CH3)
      3. start of molecular biology; restriction endonucleases to cut synthetic DNA;
         design and clone synthetic DNA (1950s) --> synthetic genes
         Î¦X174 E.coli phage:
           1977: sequenced by Fred Sanger; 11 genes; 5.3 KB letters (nucleotides)
           2003: synthesized in vitro from synthesized oligonucleotides  (human 3G/30K LTRs/genes)
      4. Found anywhere there is life, ice cores, hot springs...
           10^31 in earth = 10xbacteria
           40% of bacteria in ocean die every day
      4. spherical with tail, alien spacecraft, cylindrical, icosahedral
      5. 2 hijackings: 1. parasitic (lysogenic) - integrate DNA into host and wait
                       2. infectious(lytic); invade/high-jack, replicate/propagate:
                          1 phage wipes out bacterial population in hours
          Bacteria defenses:
            1. and DNA markers (chemical change) keeping genetic expression
               release restriction endonuclease enzymes to destroy DNA WO markers
            2. pFirefly Aerospacelug holes made by phages
            3. mask protein molecules that phages latch to
            4. sense phages and commit suicide to protect other bacteria
            5. embed phage DNA into its CRISPR DNA; molecular vaccination card
               adaptive and inheritable immunity
  Cas: CRISPR associated genes - not repeat or spacers - enzymes (proteins) to zip or cut DNA?
    when there is CRISP there is also Cas
  Research: adventure, curiosity, instinct, grit
  Yellowstone/Kamchatka viruses shared DNA --> large separation but common ancestor
    same enzyme to splice their genome to bacteria
    ---> problem: find bacterial genes that blocks virus
  Danish company: strains of Streptococcus Thermophilus (yogurt) more phage resistance
    CRISPR spacers varied in strains some matchedpart of phage genome
    more spacers ---> better phage resistance
  Bacteria creates RNA (DNA T-->U) that matches the CRISPR DNA
    enzyme break RNA into smaller pieces each having a phage sequence
    RNA pieces target both RNA and DNA of phages
    Similar to RNA interference - animal/plant cells create RNA-RNA helixes to destroy viruses
  Bacteria & human cells have complex reactions to infection.

3. CRACKING THE CODE
   Questions: How bacteria in middle of phage infection take phage DNA and add it
              to existing CRISPR array so that it can target virus?
              How CRISPR RNA produced in side the ceslls and converted from long
              to short strands? - each one virus matching sequence
              Most important, how a piece of RNA paired up with the phage DNA and
              destroyed the phage?
   4 DNA letters --> 20 amino acids (protein letters)
     Find protein: lookup amino acid chains in known protein/amino-acids.
   Study of any gene: 1. clone gene into artificial mini chromosome (plasmid)
                      2. engineer apdicalized strin of E.coli to add plasmid to its genome
                      3. add other synthetic DNA
                        --> e. coli becomes a custom protein factory
   1. create Cas plasmid from E. coli and P. aeruginosa
   2. grow overnight dozens of liters of culture of different E. coli strains
   3. separate cells from liquid in 4K g centrifuges
   4. suspend cells in small volume of salt solution
   5. burst cells with high energy acoustic waves
   6. extract Cas from thousands of other proteins using its tag
      --> found Cas1 that cuts DNA
                Cas6 that cuts RNA into small pieces
   Designed new enzymes to detect human viruses (dengue, yellow fever...)
     in blood and saliva.
   2011: Caribou Bio-sciences to commercialize Cas
      detect viral/bacterial RNA
  Type I:
     CRISPR RNA loaded with 10-11 different Cas proteins marked DNA to be destroyed
       Cas3 tear apart targeted DNA - 300 base pairs / second
       electron microscope showed Cas helical structure
       CRISPR RNA recognized viral DNA
     CRISPR diversity: 2 classes/6 types/19 subtypes
   Type II (S.pyrogenes); different Cas
     Cas9 surgically cuts viral DNA without dismantling it
     similar to gene editing ZFNs &TALENs
     S.themophilis has economic value, S.pyogenes have medical value;
       causes toxic syndrome. scarlet fever,strep throat....flesh eating bacteria
  1. create artificial chromosome containing Cas9 from S.pyrogenes
  2. add it to strains of E. coli
  3. optimize parameters  for maximum yield
  4. use chromatography totest different way of cracking E.coli
  5. test stability of Cas9 - was stable
  6. mix Cas9 with CRISPR RNA and target DNA: no DNA cutting
  7  added tracrRNA (trans-activating CRISPR RNA); DNA was cut
  Programmable DNA cutting:
    Cas9 attaches to DNA, forming DNA strand attached to CRISPR & tracrRNA strands
    --> bacteria programs Cas9 to cut specific viral DNA
    CRISPR RNA targets, tracrRNA holds CRISPR RNA and Cas9
  Experiment: fuse tails of CRISPR RNA & tracrRNA & add Cas9
              edit green fluorescent protein (GFP) gene of jellyfish; target 25 letters
              DNA was cut
      bacterial weapons --> rewriting code of life  --> joy of discovery (2012)

4. COMMAND & CONTROL
  2013 genetic engineering for sickle cell - change A to T cure millions of people
    sickle cell DNA + genetic instructions to produce Cas9 from Streptococcus
      + CRISPR derived guide RNA molecule to target the mutate cite

               + gene for nuclear localization signal (directs protein to cell's nucleus)
               + gene for green fluorescence (for cells producing Cas9 to glow green)
  Humans & all eukaryotes suffer DNA damage; carcinogens, UV, x-rays,...
  Cells repair DNA via non-homologous end joining (of broken DNA) - no repair template
    - sloppy;  add remove few letters to create clean ends- gene changed
    verify CRIPSR found & cut target DNA by finding sloppy DNA repair
    ZFN $25K, CRISPR < $100 with computer
  Edit human DNA - CTLA (endocytosis) gene:
    Kidney cell (aborted fetus) + Cas9 + CTLA-specific guide RNA

       bacterial, one-cell Zebra fish embryo
  1974: 1st transgenic mouse years effort,
  2013: CRIPSR one month multiple RN guides (gene edits)
  1. Simple & common CRISPER use: cut DNA & let cell repair it: sloppy, error prone, & useful
      Nucleus DNA copy (T-->U) --> mRNA, mRNA leaves nucleus ---> ribosome (protein factory)
        Codon (2 letter RNA) ---> 20 amino acids (protein letters) + 3 protein synthesis markers
      Gene knockout: small insert or delete during DNA repair --> protein synthesis abort
        TYR gene (in plants, animals & fungi): produce tyrosinase enzyme which make melanin in
        albino white read-eyed mice: 97% CRIPSR efficiency in Japan
  2. DNA repair of joining segments with similar sequence: homology-directed repair
       CRIPSR + repair template
  3. cut large swath of DNA; 3 possible repairs:
      a. mend both ends; less likely; DNA is moving....
      b. leave cut segment out and glue ends
      c. invert cut segment - flip cut segment & glue it
  4. Puppeteer function: disable cutting and control gene expression
      Cas9 or guide RNA + protein payloads (to enhance of diminish gene expression)
      Similar to gene expression which creates different types of cells.
      Protein 100s to 100s amino acids; most define 3-D shape, few control catalysis
  Edits: 1. Knock out (messy delete)/delete/replace/insert (add).
  Gene engineering: fluorescent CRISPER 3D gene mapping in cells,
    CRISPER for mRNA instead of DNA; add bar-codes to record cell history

   CRISPER danger vs benefits....


5. THE CRISPER MENAGERIE
  Tomatoes that slowly ripen, drought tolerant plants, mosquitoes without malaria,
  muscular dogs for police,cows WO horns, micro- pigs
  Animla models for human disease: autism in monkeys, Parkinson's in pigs, flu in ferrets
  In future:  high yield crops, healthier livestock, more nutritious food,
    pigs as human organ donors, woolly mammoths, winged lizards, unicorns
  CRISPR vs natural or induced (x-rays or chemical) mutagenesis, hybrids
  Powdery mildew resistant Barley found in 1930's in Ethiopia via
    spontaneous mutation of Mlo gene; Mlo discovered form x-ray irradiation in 1942
    2004 identify gene in barley ---> found in other plants  ---> make them resistant
  2014 China changed six Mlo genes in Common wheat (Triticum aestivum) with CRISPER
    no worries of bad side effects...
  Done: rice for bacterial blight, herbicide resistant corn/soybeans/potatoes
        mushrooms WO browning/spoiling, soybean oil WO trans fat - similar to olive oil
  Attempts: Cavendish bananas protected from soil fungus, citrus from huangglongbing bacteria
  Potato glucose fructose (from cold storage) + heat (frying)
    --> acrylamide (neurotoxin/carcinogen)
    15% potatoes in making chips thrown because sugar browning/bitter
    Ranger Russet has 70% acrylamide reduction
  GMO opposition is misinformed
    GMO definitions:
      USDA: heritable improvements of plants/animals via genetic engineering or
            traditional methods; gene editing or mutation breeding
      common: recombinant DNA/gene splicing,adding foreign DNA
    1974: slow ripen tomato (FlavrSavr) 1st GMO (discontinued)
    2015: 92/94/94% corn/cotton/soybean are GMO
    Random GMO mutations:
      Neutron radiation ---> pink grapefruit
      colchicine (treats gout) ---> seedless watermelon
    CRISPR: minor changes, no new DNA, not GMO
      Scarless gene editing: CRISPR makes changes, then cell degrades it
    EU, WHO considers them safe; 60% Americans have them not safe
  Gene editing (CRISPER) that does not add new DNA is not GMO
    similar to mutation inducing chemicals/radiation
    2016 CRISPER shifted
    Protest process not end product; use natural mutations or CRISPER....
    not USDA approval for new crops, but need FDA approval
  Start with open mind; tackle food security, malnutrition, climate adaptation
  GMO salmon - AuaAdvantage after $80 mil & 20 year FDA battle
    growth hormone 1/2 to mature; 75% people would not eat it
    Whole foods, Target.. promised not to sell
  Terminated GMOs:
    healthy pig in Japan with spinach gene to improve fat
    enviro-pig in Canada digested phytate ---> manure 75% less phosphorus
  CRISPER: muscular cows, pigs, sheep, goats
  Muscle doubling --> deactivate myostatin gene with CRISPR
    Belgian blue and Piedmontese cows 20% more muscle
    Texel sheep in Netherlands
    whippet dogs; fastest are heterozygotes (2 different gene alleles)
      AB blood is co-dominance of 2 alleles (heterozygote)
        Allele == gene version
      Blue eyes phenotype: dominant/recessive alleles
    Humans; heterozygotes --> professional athletes
      both alleles --> superman/bodybuilder
      Deactivate gene to cure musclular dystrophy?
    Pigs: 10% more lean tender meat
    Shanbei goats: myostatin & growth --> more food & cashmere
  Working on:
    Chicken female reproduction bias
    Sterile farm fish - to not pollute natural stock
    Male beef cattle bias
    Cattle resistance to parasite causing sleeping sickness
    Pigs fattened with less food
    Remove allergen in egg white/milk(Casein & whey)
    Pigs resistant to:
      PRRSV virus (Betaarterivirus suid 1 or blue ear virus)
        effects 15% of pigs; knock out susceptibility gene
      African swine fever - up to 100% mortality
        edited gene to be similar to warthog
  Recombinetics: milk cattle WO horns
    lengthy breeding replaced by CRISPR
    13 million de-hornings in USA every year
  Cynomolgus Monkeys with: immunodeficiency, obesity, human cancers;
    possible behavioral/cognitive abnormalities
  Pigs
    model: Parkinson's, immunological disorders...
    as bioreactors to produce therapeutic proteins
    micro pigs - 30 instead of 300 lbs
      $1500 as pet
  Drugs from transgenic:
    Low , high yield, easy scale-up
    Antithreombine: anticoagulant in milk goat approved by FDA
    other drugs in egg-white, rabbit milk
    With CRISPR replace pig genes with human genes
  Xenotransplantation of kidney, lungs.. from pigs
    124,000 on waiting list, 22 die each day
    pig kidney/heart lasted .5/2.5 in baboon  by Revivicor
  Inbreeding of dogs --> Labradors prone to 30 genetic conditions,
    60% golden retrievers get cancer,
    Beagles get epilepsy,
    Cavalier King Charles spaniels have seizures/pain from deformed skulls
      cannot be left alone more than one hour
    Biotech dogs avoid this....
  Can create bizarre or mythical creatures that never existed
  Resurrect:
    auroch (wild ox) in Europe
    saddleback tortoisein Galapagos
    Pyrenean ibex (wild goat) - cloned from frozen tissue but died after birth
    Woolly mammoth in Russia & Korea
      in Harvard - correct 1,668 genes (1.5M letters) difference with elephants
  Long now foundation: goal to resurrect passenger pigeons, great auks,
    gastric-brooding frogs
  De-extinction & designer pets:
    distraction from helping endangered & animal welfare
  Gene drive: drive new genes into wild populations; defy inheritance
    selfish genes: increase frequency in genome with each generation without
      any advantage to offspring  --> spread trait with 100% probability
    Add new DNA and DNA of CRISPR
    2015: fruit flies made yellow - if escaped would spread world wide
    mosquitoes resistant to malaria & sterile females
      sterile males & lethal genes self liming
    Bad:
      gene bombs - target human microbiome or food sources
    Good:
      Reverse herbicide insecticide resistance, controlling evasive species,
      Eliminate Lyme disease, schistosomiasis (from contact with water/snails),
      mosquitoes
  Inactivate gene drive: undo gene drive
  Plant/animal gene editing: dry run for curing disease

6. TO HEAL THE SICK
  1st genetic mice cures:
    China, congenial cataracts
    muscular dystrophy, metabolic disorders
  Human cell cures: sickle cell, hemophilia, cystic fibrosis, immunodeficiency,
    block HIV virus.
  1st cancer cure = gene edit + immunotherapy
  Decision for: somatic (hard/impossible) or germ (easy) cell therapies
  CRISPR:
    not good for Schizophrenia/obesity; genetics are complex, have small effect
    good for monogenic genetic diseases (delivery is hard):
      white blood cells/immunodeficieny
      brain neurons/Huntington's'
      sickle cell/red blood cells
      lung cells/cystic fibrosis
        ex vivo (out living) easiest - cells edited outside of body
          have technology and rigorous quality control
            Sickle cell & beta thalassemia; beta-globin gene (globin: heme-protein);
              Marrow transplant for thalassimia with matched donor may have
                graft-versus-host disease - gene edit (repair) avoid this.
                (Gene therapy adds new healthy genes)
              Bluebird inserted beta-globin gene into blood stem cells
        vivo is simpler but hardest
          work/research using adenovirus for thalassemia treatment
          Adeno associated virus (AAV): mild immune response, no known disease
          AAV custom strains for: liver, lungs, eyes, heart, nerves
            Duchene muscular dystrophy 1;3,600 males; starts/kills at 4/25 years
              DMD gene- largest human gene- encodes dystrophin to contract muscles
                in X chromosome - females are carriers
                2015: 4 laboratories: AAV vectors to muscles & heart cured mice
            Tyrosinemia: liver dame from accumulated toxic metabolites, die before 10
              for example: liver oxidizes methanol into formaldehyde and formic acid
              MIT cured tyrosinemia in mice - for Huntington's
            Delivered to brains/lungs/eyes of mice,;
              Huntington's/cystic fibrosis/congenital blindness
  HIV immunity: missing 32 letters in DNA for protein CCR5 (HIV virus latches to it)
    10%-20% Caucasians have one copy - other races 0%
    1% (northern Europe) have two copies (homozygous); more susceptible to West Nile virus
    ZFN: editing CCR5 gene in white blood cells

    CRISPR: 1. remove genetic material from HIV virus
            2. deactivated CRISPR to awaken HIV virus so that it can be targeted with drugs
  Cancer:
    Half million persons /year die
    Rate of DNA mutations increase --> difficult to find cause
    Use CRISPR to make mutations that cause cancer- quicker & cheaper than before.
      Harvard determined combination of mutation that cause leukemia
        by mutating several genes at once.
        (every gene in human genome can be knocked out in one experiment)
      Discovery of gene mutation that disable cancers: colorectal, servical,
         melenoma, glioblastoma (brain)
    New cancer treatment, immunotherapy: 1. check point inhibitors; shut off
      mechanisms that restrain immune response
      2. adaptive cell transfer (ACT); use generically engineered T-cells
        2015 one year old cure of leukemia using TALEN gene edited T-cells
        2016 Chinese used T-cells modified with CRISPR
        2019 clinical trial started.
    CRISPR flaw: sometimes DNA gets cut that does not match the guide RNA
      similar to drugs having off-target activity (side effects);
        antibiotics kill good and bad bacteria
      But gene therapy side effects can be very dangerous;
        Off-target edits are predictable; 20 letter CRISPR may cut 19 letter match-
          probability is less if no-match is not close to match
        Reduction/elimination of off-targets:
          1. Algorithms to scan 3B-letter genome for off-target sequences - not always successful
          2. Empirical tests for off-target edits; if none do clinical trials
          3. Change Cas9 to be more discriminate (lengthen the password)
          4. Adjust the dose - more CRISPR, more likely the off-targets
      Improved accuracy --> more clinical trials
    Expanded possible cures:
      Achondroplasia (dwarfism),
      Chronic granulomatous disease (ineffective white blood cells),
      Alzheimer's,
      Congenital hearing loss,
      Amyolotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) voluntary nerves (10% are genetic),
      High cholesterol,
      Diabetes,
      Tay-Sachs (no enzyme to break down fats),
      Skin disorders,
      Fragile X chromosome (missing brain development protein),
      Infertility
    Not so for non-genetic or genetic/environment:
      Autism,
      Heart disease
    Germline editing: ethics, implications, ....


7. THE RECKONING
  CRISPR: make human genome as editable as that of bacteria
    --> eliminate human disease before birth/conception
    Genome is like palimpsest - book erased and written over
    "A living creature understands its origin and can design its future"
    Mot if, but when and how.
    1978: first test tube baby Louise Brown in England - In vitro Fertilization
    1990s: mouse models of human diseases
    1996: cloned sheep Dolly (after 277 attempts)
    1998: "Engineering the Human Genome" conference
    PGD (Pre-implantation genetic diagnosis): single gene defects: Down syndrome
      cystic fibrosis, Tay-Sachs disease, sickle cell anemia, and Huntington disease.
      using polymerase chain reaction (PCR)
      $4,000-$10,000 (gender choosing ~$4,000); CNY fertility
      (natural 106 males to 100 females, China up to 140, India, Caucasus....)
      Down syndrome detectable from blood test (mother blood has baby DNA)
      Selective abortion
      PGD avoidsFamilies of Sandy Hook victims say they have been harassed by Jones' followers issues of embryo selection
    Gender selection illegal in China, India...
      Legal in US
      Legal in Uk to avoid X-linked disease (mostly for males)
    Savior siblings (2015): born to provide HLA (human leukocyte antigens); 1% of PGD;
      compatible body parts
        umbilical cord blood for bone marrow transplantation, kidney...
        prone to graft-versus-host disease
      controversial but legal
    Future: physical appearance, behavior,intelligence ---> best embryo
    Mitochondrial replacement therapy - 3-parent IVF; avoid mitochondrial diseases
      approved in UK 2015; controversial; changes the human genome.
    Doudna has dream with Hitler having a pig face
      (humanized pig genome written by CRISPR)
      Goal: cure disease,  Unintended: DIY bio-hacking for few hundred dollars
      Risks:
        Science may not be done openly
        Public discussion way behind science
        Backlash hinder gene therapies
      feel like Dr. Frankenstein,
        Oppenheimer: "do the technically sweet then argue what to do about it"
        fear of nuclear weapons --> fear of undermining trust of bio technology
      How to save CRISPR from itself
    Paul Berg: 2070s gene spliced (chemical fusion) of: 1. lamda phage,
      2. E. coli, 3.simian virus 40 (SV40)  to study genes outside their environment
      Concerns:
        Synthetic DNA get out of lab, SV40 causes cancer in mice...
      "Berg letter": moratorium on: Creating antibiotic resistant bacteria,
                                    DNA hybrids with virus that causes cancer

8. WHAT LIES AHEAD
  2015: Huang injected CRISPR into 86 human (triploid; non-viable) embryos
    for beta-globin gene; cure for beta-thalassemia.
      1. CRISPR (RNA with GPS coordinates),
      2. synthetic DNA to repair bad gene
      3. jellyfish gene for green fluorescence
    4/86 had intended mutations, others edited off-target DNA, cut DNA  WO repair,
    mosaic of repairs (differently edited versions of beta-globin gene)
    Experiments with triploid embryos are legal in the US.
    Published in "Protein and Cell" (Springer)
    Nature/Science rejected paper on ethical grounds
  2018 He Jiankui created babies designed with HIV protection
    got 3 year jail sentence
  Russian scientist  plans to create babies without deaf mutation
  Genome editing weapon of mass destruction and proliferation;
    virus, or mosquito may hurt people by altering their genes
  Most scientists against human genome editing,
    some not so; "gene-editing is a moral necessity",
    "primary goal of bioethics is to get out of the way"
  World conference on genome editing:
    1. safety: benefits outweigh risks?  anticipate worst effects
    2. ethical: abortion, experimental viable/un-viable embryos
    3. regulatory: prevent disease acceptable, enhancements not
  2-10 DNA mutations every time a cell divides;
    each person: one million mutations/second
    In intestinal epithelium, every letter in the genome has mutated by 60
    sex cells have new mutations
    zygote starts with 50-100 random mutations
    genetic editing mutation is a drop in the maelstrom of natural mutations
      (CRISPR is safe?)
  Genome editing options:
    Edit embryo and use PGD to detect rare(?) undesirable mutations
    Edit sex cells instead of embryo; this maybe possible in the future
  Given the speed of technology, germline editing will have no more risks
    than natural reproduction.
  Editing:
     1. CCR5 improves/degrades HIV/West-Nile-Virus resistance.
     2. sickle-cell gene, increases malaria susceptibility
     3. cystic fibrosis carrier gene, increase tuberculosis susceptibility
     4. Alzheimer's, may reduce cognitive function, memory in young adults?
  George Church (Harvard):
    1. Requirement for complete knowledge of genome at odds with medical reality
    2. Four centuries fighting smallpox without knowing immune system
    3. Changing genome to healthy version that billion share, more certain
       than a new drug never tested on humans
  Cautious approval based on safety; but if we can, should we?
  Recessive genetic disorders: cystic fibrosis, sickle cell, albinism, Fanconi anemia
  Dominant: Huntington's, early-onset Alzheimer's, Marfan syndrome (tall & thin)
    US adults 50%/48% in-favor/against
  Christians oppose it, Jews/Muslims not so
  Evolution:
    worked at it 3.85 billion years, can we do better without side-effects?
    did nothing for modern life...
    more of tinkerer than engineer
  Natural vs unnatural:
    in medicine there is no distinction...
  People with genetic disease are 100% pro edit;
    issue of choice - people will do the right thing(?)
  UNESCO: "human genome is heritage of humanity", genome editing renew eugenics
    disguised as improvement.
  If we use CRISPR to eliminate disease, we will use it for enhancements
    intelligence, beauty, talents... no identified genes, but may change...
    Slippery slope...
      Genes for enhancements:
        EPOR - erythropoietin (sport doping)
        LRP5 - stong bones
        MSTN (myostatin) - more muscle (super pigs & dogs)
        ABCC11 - lower armpit odor
        DEC2 - lower sleep requirement
      Genes for cures:
        PCSK9 - regulate low-density cholesterol
        CCR5 - HIV resistance
        APOE - reduce Alzheimer's risk
        1F1H1/SLC30A8 - reduces type 1/2 diabetes
        GRH - reduce cancer
   Gene therapy ~ $1M; for rich
   IVF/PGD costs thousands of dollars - not covered by insurance
     Not so in France, Swede, Israel....
   Gene gap (like digital divide), inequality will increase....
   Germline editing ---> transcribe inequality into genetic code
     --> exacerbate existing prejudices
     (Nazis perfect race; eliminate Jews, homosexuals, mentally ill...)
     Eugenics (literally well born)
       Ultra sound, PGD, prenatal vitamins, alcohol abstinence
   Clinical genome edit needs FDA approval;
     IVF  & PGD had no clinical trials or FDA review
   Editing:
     US: Legal in most states, government cannot fund it, FDA cannot review drugs
       developed by editing - because drugs are automatically approved after 30
       days, it must act as it did not receive them.
     UK: legal, active, approved by Human Fertilization & Embryology Authority
     EU: "genetic therapy" legal if not change "germline genetic identity"
     France: illegal if it undermines integrity of human species; PGD is legal
     Mexico: legal if it reduces serious disease
   Restrictions --> CRISPR tourism (China, Japan, India...)
     now millions spent for stem cell treatments, muscle/lifespan increase
   Nuclear weapons reshaped global politics & peoples lives
     this will do the same....
   Discovery:
     space travel --> explore planets
     particle physics --> understanding of matter
     gene editing --> rewrite language of life, control genetic identity
   Brave New World, 2540, genetic castes; will be sooner
  CRISPR
    is to genetic disease as vaccine to smallpox
    solve world hunger
    weather climate change

EPILOGUE: THE BEGINNING
  Public distrust of science:
    climate change deniers
    anti vaccine
    anti genetically modified food
    anti CRISPR GM babies
    Cause: ignorance
           miscommunication --> scientists partially responsible
    Fix: ensure knowledge flows freely
         discussion without dictation
         open-access of papers
         cross-disciplinary courses, research projects
    Book take away: humans need to explore through open-ended research;
      1. Flemming's Staphylococcus experiment --> penicillin
      2. DNA cutting and copying enzyme from gut/heat-loving bacteria -->
         recombinant DNA
      3. Hot spring bacteria --> rapid DNA sequencing
      4. How bacteria fights virus --> CRISPR
    We must support new finding in all areas of science.
    Unlock one secret of nature --> end of experiment --> beginning of many others.

    Gone: evolution 's  exclusive prodding control of life.
    New era: we will have primary control of life (life's genetic makeup)
    Evolution:
      Deaf dumb blind system --> conscious, intentional, human directed
