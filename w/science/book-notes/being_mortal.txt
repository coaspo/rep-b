Atul Gawande, surgeon ðŸ—“ 2014

Intro
  Why become doctor: satisfaction of work (competence)
    competence --> secure sense of identity
  Making mortality medical: a decades old failing experiment.
  Our last days controlled by medicine, technology, and strangers.

1. The independent self
  In past, elders: fewer, more respected, with political power.
  Now more elders; 2% in 1790, now 15%-20%
      more chance for conflict.
  Elder's knowledge/wisdom replaced by technology.
  Prosperity: follow your own path, marry whom you want,
              reject traditional old age; (WE DO NOT WANT IT)
              with resources & opportunity, traditional life rejected
  "retirement community" 1st in Arizona 1960; "intimacy at a distance"
  Elder veneration --> self veneration

2. Things fall apart
  Modern medicine: 1. biological transformation (longevity)
                   2. culture transformation on how to live
        (transformed life from short cliff curve to long fade curve)
  teeth indicate age with 5 year accuracy
  loose jaw muscle - switch to softer cavity prone food;
     by 60, average loss 30% of teeth
  Bones/teeth  soften everything else hardens;
    bone density better than cholesterol to predict atherosclerosis
  Aging, reduction of :
    teeth enamel
    blood supply to pulp/roots
    saliva
    gums become inflamed & pull away from teeth
    nerves less sensitive - unaware of cavity/gum problems
    chewing ability less --> softer foods --> more cavities
    bones soften, rest of body hardens;
      more calcium in: blood vessels, joints, muscle & lungs
    blood vessels stiffen and narrow --> blood pressure up
      hear capacity down  --> less stamina
    heart muscle thickens, other muscles thin
       thumb muscle of elderly is flat
    less touch sensitivity + fewer motor neurons --> dexterity loss
       worse handwriting, harder to use phone
    lung capacity decrease
    bowels slow down
    glands slow down or stop
    brain shrinks --> 1 inch by seventies
      prone to cerebral bleeding because brain rattles
      frontal lobe/hippocampus shrink -->
        judging planning / memory declines
      processing speed down; by 80, 40% people have dementia
    Lipofuscin: yellow/brown spots on skin; cell waste cannot be cleared
      easier to get heat stroke/exhaustion
    eye lens: less elastic --> farsightedness in 40s
              yellows (age, UV, diabetes, cholesterol) --> cataracts
    light in 60-yr old retina is 1/3 of 20 yr old
    more cellular aging mechanism;
      accumulate lipofuscin, free radicals, DNA mutations...
  Why age?
    1. not wear & tear - different species have different lifespans
    2. genetics - bamboo/flowers lives for 100/1 years
    Caenorhabditis elegans nematode  (new rod; https://wormbase.org/) 1mm in soil
      lived 2x longer after a gene change
  Historically death not related to age; except for last 200 years, 30 yr lifespan.
    "Rectangularization": pyramid (young in base) became rectangle
  Now: cling to 65 yr retirement
       save less for retirement
       have fewer kids
       more than 1/2 of very old have no spouse
  Longevity not genetic:
    1. 3%/90%  based on parents longevity/height
    2. identical twins typical more than 15 yr gap
  Humans, like complex systems, die randomly & gradually
    Power plant have redundant backups for longer longevity.
    Humans have 2 kidneys/lungs/gonads, DNA/cell repair systems
    wear down until we cannot wear more down
  Economic drivers:
    geriatric/plastic surgeon, radiology enrollments down/up
     + lot of doctors do not like elder care - no glamour in untreatables
  Geriatrician: always check feet
                  dirty feet: neglect & danger
                biggest danger is falling - not cancerous nodules...
                  poor balance, too many medications, muscle weakness
                job is to support quality of life:
                  1. keep disease down 2. maintain world engagement
                  going to nursing home is a medical problem
                prescribe: podiatrist visits, eliminate diuretic drug,
                  eat snack, eliminate low calorie/cholesterol food,
                  eat with friends/relatives (for stimulation).
                deliberate focus on task; do not think of other things
                counter depression by having a purpose;
                  be of service to others
                eat looking down because of spine lordosis (head tips forward)
                avoid isolation
                monitor teeth, bones, weight
    hard to find Geriatrician; 100 diplomas/yr in US
  Most doctors can treat disease but do not know what to do with elders.
    Study demonstrated this, but geriatrics dpt shut down
    geriatrics cost more than save money
  Retirement community: $32K/yr + $40-120K fees/yr, elder income: $15K/yr


3. Dependence
  Old age is continuous series of losses;  not a battle but a massacre.
  Do not think about ultimate dependence --> not prepared
  Poorhouses/workhouse/poor-farms: pre 1935/Social security; "unfit to house animals"
    elder paupers,  mentally ill, drunks, immigrants
    catch tuberculosis, die alone, wonders were shackled
    now in poor countries; breakup of extended family & no affluence
      In India: house hospital, nursing home, family rejects; 60-->100+ year olds
        for example previous shop owner with accountant, software engineer kids
        staying in closest thing to hell
  Nursing home residents: "it's not like home"
    Harry Truman choose not to leave and die in volcano eruption --> movie made
    Independent living, no hell, but loss of control
    Choose one: 1. go down with Mt St. Helena volcano 2. yield total control
  Medical history: poorhouse --> nursing home;
    Great depression --> retirement savings gone --> social security pension (1935)
    pension help healthy but not sick;  poorhouses stayed full
    1937: hospital care/food... not medicine may have made a difference
      hospitals emptied poorhouses
    1945+ antibiotics, surgery.. hospitals symbols of sickness to cure/hope
    1954 hospitals got custodial units (nursing homes) for chronically ill
      Nursing homes clear hospital beds - not to help dependent people.
      (systems devised to solve a problem)
    1965: medicare; pay only if standards (somewhat) met;
      "somewhat" had no legal basis;
    1970: 13,000 nursing homes built;  people died in fire or poisoning
      Now: safer but core problem remains - not built for people
      Like military camps, orphanages, mental institutions cut off from society
        --> "total institutions"
          Modern social arrangements: people sleep, play, work in different:
          places, people, authority --> no rational plan
            1. life in one place, under central authority
            2. a persons daily activity in company of large group
                 all in group required to do the same
            3. activities tightly scheduled by formal rulings of officials
            4. Enforced activities fulfill institution aims (caring not living)
    Nursing home belief: loose independence --> worthy/free life not possible
      resistance (feisty): rebel, do not cooperate; diabetics eating cookies
        --> result from facing mortality without thinking about it
            not how to make life worth living

4. Assistance
  Nursing home or family --> Cannot image anything else
  Chances of avoiding nursing home proportional to number of kids
  Postural or orthostatic hypo-tension: blood pressure drop from standing up
  Keren Wilson invented assisted living:
    her mother in nursing home: "take  me home";  proposed the solution
    with her husband built 112 unit Park place in Portland
    radical idea, too risky; cannot check safety; freedom or neglect victims?
    study proved it a success with 20% lower cost than nursing homes
    solve : "what makes life worth living when we are frail?"
    with socialogist husband, created Assisted Living concepts
      3,000 employees
  Maslow "A theory of human motivation": air, water, food at bottom; pyramid of:
    (bottom)physiological, safety, belong/love, esteem, self-actualization (top)
    top: self-fulfillment via moral or creative ideals
    if safety/survival are prime, we are limited -
      not always true people sacrifice themselves
  Getting older:
    spend time with family instead of new people
    focus on being than doing
    on present than future
    Carstensen, had near death experience when 21, in hospital realized
      relationships more important than achievements,  treated better than
      older roommates  --> study aging; found:
        less prone to anxiety, depression, anger
        shift from achieving to appreciating
        change in needs/desires depends on perception of a finite life, not age
      when young, follow Maslow's pyramid, when old focus on now & people
      "how we seek to spend time depends on how much time we think we have
        --> "socioemotional selective theory" (or perception matters)
        poof: young terminally ill have same goals as old --> relationships
          PERSPECTIVE NOT AGE MATTERS
          Tolstoy: ambition/vanity --> desire for comfort& companionship
  Assisted living popularity --> corruption; boarding houses, redecorated nursing homes
    founding philosophy not kept; became a layover to nursing homes
    fear of safety/lawsuit took over;
      language of medicine with priority on safety took over
    easier/faster to dress someone than letting them dress themselves
    good medicine metrics but not for assisted living
    Assisted living build for children of elders; create the visuals - hotel like....
      children not elders decide
      we want autonomy for ourselves and safety for those we love
    Life designed to be safe but empty.

5. A better life
  Dr Bill Thomas as a kid had Oppositional Defiant Disorder (ODD),
    was good salesman (accepted rejections)
    (ODD managed with parent management training (PMT))
    rode bike 330 miles from Harvard to home town, had farm, 5 kids - lived authentic life
    saw nursing homes contradict self-sufficiency
    --> nursing home experiment (Eden Alternative):
      add plants/animals kids to nursing homes;
      attack the 3 plagues: 1. loneliness 2. boredom 3. helplessness
      sold proposal for dogs//cats birds into nursing home
      culture = habits + expectations (and inertia to stifle renovation)
        to fight inertia - did big band; staff kids,gardens,dogs,cats,birds,plants at once
        created pandemonium with Thomas smiling; patients laughed;
        beauty was we did not know what we were doing
      --> lights on people's eyes turned on
        deaths fell 15%, agitation/schizophrenia drug Haldol decreased
        most important: possible to find reason to live
        unlike drugs/longevity, cannot measure how much people value life
    started Green House project - elderly homes from ground up
  Josiah Royce, Philosophy of Loyalty:
    why existing (housed, fed, safe, alive) is meaningless?
      what do we need to feel worthwhile?  answer Loyalty (anti-individualism):
        family, country, principle, or small; project, pet
    we always had the selfish, but right to be selfish is ingeniously defended.
      we need loyalty, even if painful, for life to be endurable
      desires give torment
      always a collection of impulses;
        cannot see inner light --> try seeing an outer light
    death is not meaningless if we are part of something greater
      solution to paradox: outside the cause, inner the will with delight to cause
      --> transcendence, above Maslows self-actualization:
        desire to see others reach their potential
        Thomas' Eden Alternative enabled expression of loyalty
        1992 Sterile environment + animals + kids + plants = magic
          because medicine has no view of what makes life significant
  NewBrdidge on the Charles, luxury 8K/month:
    pods of 16 private rooms with shared living space; based on research < 20
  Terror of sickness & old age is loss & isolation
    but with right conditions can still have autonomy

6. Letting go
  25% of medicare is for 5% of people in final year of life - mostly last 2 months
    $12K/month chemo, $4K/day intensive, $7K/hour surgery;  $94K/yr average;
    intensive: warehouse of dying
    "holding on" care --> worse quality of life +
                          caregiver prone to depression 6 moths after death
  terminally ill: 1. prolong life 2. avoid suffering 3. strengthen relationships
                  4. mentally aware 5. not be burden 6. sense of complete life
  Before modern medicine people died within days of serious illness
    Tuberculosis or some cancers took a year
    like bad weather - no warning
    Ars moriendi (The art of dying) 1415:  stoic, no fear, no self-pity
      repent, let go of desires/things, get forgiveness from god,
      reverence of last words
  With modern medicine: long struggle, how and when is uncertain
    Bowel obstruction --> ruptured colon
       --> heart attack, septic shock, kidney failure
       --> operation, stent, dialysis, ventilator, gangrene
       was she dying? - medical science made obsolete sense of mortality
                        created new problem how to die
  Hospice: 1/4 accepted dying, for cancer patient:
    morphine, ativa (anxiety), compazine (nausea), haldol (delirium),
    tylenol (fever), atropine (dry up air way), nutrition infusion
    --> modern "ars moriendi" for those who accept it
  Cancer therapy gives a year or two, but patients want 10 to 20 years
    63% doctors overestimate 530% time left
      reluctant to give prognosis
      offer treatment which they do not believe - "customer is always right"
        fantasy is easier, less emotional...
    sometimes underestimate because of the long tail;
      Stephen Gould "The media isn't the message"
      with surgery & experimental chemo lived 20 years
      --> culture of the long tail
          million dollars for medical lottery tickets
  Tragedy: imagine we have more time, instinct to fight
           and making remaining time worse
  Estate of terminally ill got $89 million settlement for
    insurance refusing treatment.
  Hospice enrolled reduced emergency visits;
    talking with hospice nurse or doctor
      --> live 25% more, die at peace, family with less depression
      (we are doing harm instead of confronting mortality)
      Hospice gave 0/3/6 weeks extra time for colon,breast/pancreas/lung cancer
    discussions lower hospital costs, anxiety...
      1. listen more than talk
      2. confront anxiety, instead of laying out options
      3. do not distance self;
         instead of "I am sorry", "I wish things were different"
      4. ask what is most important if time is short
      5. do it even though
       it is uncomfortable
  Function of medicine is unresolved; what to pay doctors to do
    lengthy difficult discussions instead of chemo or surgery...
  Death is a non-winnable fight, need to know when to surrender
  Patients/family have doubt, fear, desperation, medicine fantasies;
    doctor/nurses do hard discussion... based on experience...

7. Hard conversations
  By 2030 1/2 to 2/3 world population middle aged
  Prolonging life with the suffering is going global
  Medical developments:
    1. extreme poverty, die at home
    2. developed economy, die at hospital (1945 peak in USA)
    3. highest economic level, seek quality, die at home
  Patient agrees, doctor promises cure at whatever cost
  Doctor/patient relationships:
    1. paternalistic - doctors knows best for poor, elder ; do what told
    2. informative - give facts & figures, patient decides
       know more science and less the patient
    3. interpretive - share decisions - ask what is most important, worries...
  Ileosomy (ileum-small intestine) - temporary (3-6 months) or permanent opening
  from small intestine  to give time for colon to heal - pouch emptied 5-8/day
  ODTAA syndrome (one damn thing after another)
  2 biologists in Athens Ohio duplicate Beacon Hill Village
    100 people each $400/year, hired handyman, volunteers to help...
  Finitude of time left is a gift to re-prioritize
  Hard choices, like life do not stop
    Ketamine (short-acting anesthetic with hallucinogenic effects) for pain
    default (most aggressive) is easy - prioritizing is complicate/exhaustive
    live best possible day no sacrificing time for later
    difficult conversations --> hospice --> large payback

8. Courage
  380 BC Plato: Socrates asked what is courage? - fight with or without armor?
    Courage:
      Endurance or soul? Socrates: no - best may be to flee instead
      Wise endurance? Socrates: is wisdom related to endurance?
      Knowing what to fear or hope? Socrates: no may have courage without knowing
      Strength in face of knowing fears & hopes (wisdom is prudent strength)
        1. confront mortality
        2. act on truth we find (more difficult)
      Uncertainty --> Wise courage unclear
        Deeper: decide if fears/hopes should matter most
   How to think for now/future?
     Daniel Kahneman "Thinking Fast and Slow":
       "Peak-End" pain in surgery remembered most even though it was brief
       --> extreme pain can be remembered less if the end is moderate
           similar  with pleasure - team plays great but fumble in end is remembered
   People view life as a story not averages --> pain/joy at end/peak most important
   There are priorities over being safe or living longer
   "Assisted suicide" - "Death with dignity":
      allow people to refuse food/treatment
      allow patients to: stop their pacemaker
        take narcotics even when it shortens their life
    Assisted suicide: Netherlands, Belgium, Switzerland, Washington, Oregon, Vermont,
      3% Dutch sought it - no palliative care - want good life not good end
    Hip pain, dr recommended book "let go of pain", later had cancer diagnosis
    "Dying role": share memories, pass wisdom, settle relationships,
                  ensure those behind will be OK
                  For dying and living.

Epilogue
  Being mortal = struggle within biological constraints
  Medicine not just health and survival but to enable well-being
  Serious illness, ask what is yout:
    1. understanding & possible outcomes
    2. fears and hopes
    3. acceptable trade-offs
    4. plan that best serves this understanding
  Healthcare providers: help people struggle within the human limits
    or inflict damage otherwise
  Author got Giardia (from human/animal feces) after sipping ceremonial Ganges water
  Life is short, place in world is small.
  People are links in history.
