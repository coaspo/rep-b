Honey fungus, Armillaria, weighhs hunders of tons over 10 square kms
90% of plant depend on mycorrhizal fungi  which for a network; ""wood wide web""
Network made of many cells (hyphae)  which make up the mycelium (roots).
km rod schlture underground in Germany
Trees trasfer nutrients via hte hypae
Mushroom, the fruit, also made of hyphae.
Truffle uses chemicals to signal their readiness to be eaten
Fungi feed nematodes
Fungal computers as a an nevironment sensors.
Lederberg's horizontal gene transfer is norm for bacteria
Lychens break up rock and when they die create soil.
Lichens like tradigrs survive pace andradiation; up to 9,000 years old
Margulis endosymbiosis - one or more organisms live inside another
fungs are in roots of trees: mycorrhiza (1885)- in most vascular plants
zombi fungi; infect carpetner ants with summit desease - get to highest point
and clamp jaws around plant - fruit mushroom and disperse spores
infected by Ophiocorprdyceps; may create ergot-like alkaloid (LSD)?
Industrial africlure has dispure fungus/plant eco systems
Mycoheterotroph (other [non-photosynthesis] feeder) plants using only fungus
Example: white plant monotropa
Ecovative - make plastic, leather, and foam replacements from hyphae
Dampen book and seed it wiht Pleurotus mycelium, and eat oyser mushrooms
Mash pages with weak acid (cellulose to sugars) add yeast and drink beer
Radical mycology - DIY fungus projects

An Atlantic article, has the Lychens have two funguses, and one algae
ascomycetes and (newly discovered) basidiomycetes.
People lab grown lychens may now be possible
