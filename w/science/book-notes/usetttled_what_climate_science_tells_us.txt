.Unsettled  What climate science tells us, what it doesn't, and why it matters.
Steven E. Koonin theoretical physicist, director for Urban Science at NYU.


Intro
  "The science says the earth is doomed" - not quite; globe is warming and
  humans are exerting warming influence but the science does not say what you think it says.
  UN/US reports:
    Not human influence on hurricanes
    Green not shrinking faster than 80 years ago
    Climate change will have minimal economic impact
  Disconnect comes from telephone game - reporters are not scientists
  APS workshop to stress test of climate science:
    1. Humans exert but physically small warming influence,
       deficiency of data makes it difficult to find out how small (if small?)
    2. Climate models disagree with each other
    3. Media/government reports different from science reports
    4. Science insufficient to predict climate over decades, less on human effects
  2018-2019 APS report:
     IPCC concluded human-induced warming reached 1.0+0.2ºC since the late 19th
     century. For 21st, human-induced warming is within +20% of observed warming
  Author WJ op-ed: climate change is not settled (or a hoax)
    --> political fight because like breaking mafia's omerta
    Democrats adopted climate alarming; John Kerry proposed spending $2 trillion
      Decision is based on values; economic, environment...
        but should also be based on understanding uncertainties
    When you see something not right, you have moral obligation to act

  Commercial: Wesson oil does not soak into food - but all oils do same...
  Climate science is similar..
  Being effective
   (emotions) /being honest (science) - double ethical bind
  "It does not matter what is true it only matters what people believe"

  global mean T=14.85C σ=.07 --> 2/3 chance (68%) that is between 14.78 & 14.92
  Social/empirical/physics science: significant if confidence is 2σ/3σ/5σ
    confidence: 95%/99.7%/99.99994% (physics use σ, others use p-value)
    NBA-type height 10 standard deviations away from the mean
    1987 crash: 30 standard deviations  from the mean in one day
      >5σ stock prices (1 in 3,488,555 chance; p-value 3x10-7;
       if Higgs does not exist, 3x10-7  probability that data is at least as extreme

  Book premise:
    Earth has warmed in last century because of natural (sun) and human influence.
    Human effect from CO2 has small effect on climate. Most weather is within past variability.
    Climate models cannot predict future climate.

1. What we know about warming
  Iconic graph 1850-2020 1C (1.8F) temperature anomaly - not rise)
    In NY annual average more than 2C
    UN climate definition: 30 yr average
    1987: Thermometers less than 1,200 km (750 miles) have similar temperature changes
      Iconic graph generated by this idea by 4 groups
         baseline is 1951-1980 average
    1940-1980 small cooling due to natural effects
  1895-2018 temperature change map: most due to urbanization, oil/gas production
    population growth - not CO2
  UN "climate change" definition: human caused - (what are the natural?)
    book will use human-cause climate change
  Ocean 3.7 km (12K ft) average depth
    Argo 2005 world wide 2km depth measurements (deep argo will do 6 km)
      works with Jason satellites (sea level rise)
      1990-2020 ocean energy up by 200-300 Zeta (10^21) Joules
        World generated energy: 0.6 Zeta Joules
      Temperature change few hundreds C - but surest indication of warming.

    Tree rings (15K yr range): little ice age 1450-1850  - mixed with precipitation
      Ice cores / ocean sediment 3/500 million yrs (homo sapiens 300K years, apes 6 mil)
         +5C 20K yrs ago ended ice age
         ocean sediment shows 15C variation over 100 million years

2. Humble human influences
  Earth 30% albedo (absorbs 70% solar radiation) +/-.01 monthly
  1930 Danjon measured 39% albedo from the moons earth shine
    corrected for moons porosity --> ~30%
    self-calibrating - measure ration of reflected versus earth shine
    albedos from 1999-201444 with .003% accuracy - same as satellite - no change
       2x less accurate than satellite  but 1,000 lest cost
  Albedo gives -18C (0F) average temp. actual (greenhouse gases) is 15C (59F)
    Argon more than H2O, CO2, CH4, NOx, O3 but they trap 83% of heat
      H2O 90%, CO2 7% (1750/2020 --> 280/410 ppm;
                       82.1%/82.7% absorption)
    Double CO2 (+3/10,000 molecules) --> +1% heat trapping (15+3C aver. temp)
                                         +1% temp in Kelvin
    agriculture methane & other gases about same effect
    aerosols from coal (cause mil deaths/yr) & volcanos, deforestation increase albedo
      --> global cooling  (0.6C 1991 cooling from mt. Pinatubo)
    sun fluctuations: ~0.1% in days/weeks from tree rings: 0.2% to 0.6% in centuries
    Earth radiates 239 W/m2 (human influence 2W/m2 [actual 1to 3])--> half cucumber in daily diet
      Geothermal 0.1 W/m2 - Antarctica volcanoes have big effect
      Human generated 0.03 W/m2 (100x smaller than other human influence)
