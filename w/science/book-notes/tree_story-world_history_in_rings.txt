Valerie Trouet  paleoclimatologist University of Arizona

1. Trees in desert
  Andrew Douglas (1867-1962): 1900 reported brightening of Mars
    --> Lowell: as a message from inhabitants of Mars
    --> Douglas: "Lowell has strong literary instinct and no scientific instict"
          1906 Laboratory of Tree Research, Tuscon AZ; advantage:
            old pine drought resistant & archaeological preserved pines
    Interests in cycles of: 1. 11 year solar sunspot  2. solar energy 3. climate
    Ponderosa pine/Giant Sequioa: 450/3,200 years
    1929 living-tree chronology: Pueblo Bonito 919-1127 AD

  More than 100 tree labs around the world
  NOAA InternaltionalTree-Ring Bank;
    https://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/data-access/paleoclimatology-data/datasets/tree-ring
  1580, pointer year, entire Southwest was parched

2. Count the Rings down in Africa
   Kigoma Nigeria, lake Tanganyika: backpack with tree borers & GPS stolen
     Next to Ujiji a slave-trade hub
     Mailed 30 cookies (cross sections) --> in Belgium, 6 months later
   Trees complain of a bigger tree, fires, or "talk about weather"
     complaints are "limiting factors"
     sample dry/cold regions to reconstruct droughts/temperatures
       temperature: high latitudes/altitudes - Siberia, Alps..
       drought: Mediterranean, monsoons
   "The field": motivation; austere & beautiful landscapes

3. Adonis, Methusaleh, & Prometheus
  Trees, like humans, grow tall/wide when young/old
  Hyperion is a coast redwood (Sequoia sempervirens) 380 ft
  Bosnian pines, pindus heldreichii, in Pindos tallest peak - mt. Smolikas
    Adonis 1,075 year old = 3 ft sample core - oldest tree in Europe
      Adonis: mortal god of beauty & desire; "dying-and-rising god"
      Clonal tree roots 10K years, carbon dating, - (root sucker reproduction)
        Pando in Utah, populus tremuloides (quaking aspen) 80K years 40K stems,
          each stem maximum 130 years;
        Old Tjiko in Sweeden, picea abies (Norway spruce), 9,550 K years
      Heritage trees: large, old, historical, cultural
        3,000 year claims, more likely 600 to 800 years
        Yews in British churches - branches drop & form roots
          symbolizes Celtic culture, all parts poisonous; taxane - anti-cancer
        Olive trees (Olea europaea), 6 subspecies, 83 cultivars
        Hundred horse chestnut (Castanea sativa) in mt Aetna Sicily
          named by a poet
  Adonis: +1.5 mm diameter/year,
    pioneer species; eastern cottonwood (populus deltoides) +1in(25.4mm)/year
      work/play hard & die young - better burn out than fade away
  Bristlecone pine (Pinus longaeva): DATE MORE THAN 5K years
    in dolomite  outcrops; "Ancient Bristlecone Pine Forrest" in CA
    strip barking - strips of alive bark
    Methusaleh: 4,789 years (in Bible descent of Adam lived 969 years)
      older tree in world - location kept secret
      Discover died at 49; urban legend whoever works with these trees dies young
  1964: oldest tree in world 4,862, Prometheus, cut down to count its rings;
    murder, a dendrologist graduate student, switched to studying salt flats
  2012: 5,062 year old tree found - location secret
  Remnant wood from trees that died 8K years ago.
    Cross dating --> 8.8K year chronology
                 --> climate change studies, carbon dating & ice core calibration
  Oldest Giant Sequoia stump: 3,220 years
  2K+ trees: Coastal redwoods
             western juniper
             Rocky Mt bristlecone pine
             foxtail pine - allin southwest

             baobab (Adansonia digitata) in Namibia via radiocarbon dating
             alerce (Patagonian cypress) in Chile
             bald cypress in North Carolina swamps
               sinker wood: logs lost in rivers - expensive and very durable
               "Walker inter-glacial Swamp" has 130K preserved cypress stumps

4. And the tree was happy
  mount core & sand them with 80-1,200 grid - ring boundaries few cells wide
  conifers: large square cells in spring, getting smaller late summer fall
  broad leaf: large circular vessels --> smaller vessels
  early/late wood not in tropics - temperature is constant, except for:
    teak in south-east Asia, arapari in Amason,...
  happy tree: plenty of water and water, goodPersonalized Nutrition climate, no attackers
  cross-date: visual or statistical pattern matching
  dendrochronologist knows by heart:
    1783: narrow, 1792: wide, 1796: very narrow (matching pointer year)...
  reference (to present) chronology (coring year): 20 or more live trees
  missing ring: no ring on drought year
  false ring: in monsoon - 2 rings in one year
  subfossil oaks in Germany --> continuous chronology to 8,480 BC
    synchronized with oaks in Irish bogs - do  not know why - climate is different
  petrified wood has measurable rings- million year old cannot be connected to
    12K year chronology
    255 to 23 million years ago --> Antarctic plant families in South America..
      more CO2 (not earth tilt) --> warmer temperatures
  carbon-14 (5.7K year half life) --> works if CO2 is constant
    diluted with fossil fuels & increased with nuclear testing - 1963 spike (last year)
    +tree rings --> calibration curve
    pile dwellings (in water) in Europe 1K years before pyramids (1yr accuracy)
    earliest pyramid: 2630 to 2622 BC
  World's oldest building: Horyu (learning) temple in Japan
    records have it constructed 711 AD, but beam (recycled) was cut 594 AD
  Log cabins in US build generations after official historical date
    (tendency to makes things older... godd for tourism)
  1,000 year old door still in use in Westminster Abbey
  Art thought original was a copy
  Tree provenance (place of origin) in North America & Europe
    Baltic timber trade
  Tree harvesting of large tree collections --> timeline of tree harvesting
  Bubonic plague (black death) 1246-53 harvest gap from Ireland to Greece
    ~50% population reduction --> forests rebounded

5. Hockey stick poster child
  Climate reconstruction via paleo-climate proxies: ice cores, lake sediments, tress, corals
  Narrow ring in Pyrenee pines: dry or cold summer
    ring radiometry to measure wood density (Personalized Nutritionfast growth) --> summer temperature
    robust reconstruction from 1260
    Instrumental temperature since 1882
      T = a*d +c    d is late-wood density [gr/cm3], a,c constants
        T from: rainfall verus temperature, instrument data from multiple regions
        d from: one or multiple tree species/locations
        d sensitive to May, August, September temperatures
  1998 Mann, Bradely, Hughes (climologist,paleoclimologist,dendrochronologist):
    northern hemisphere temperature for last 600 years --> hockey stick
    1902-1998 Reconstruction & instrumental temperature increase
    Michael Mann's life threatened
    Intergovernmental Panel on Climate & Al Gore won 2007 Nobel peace prize
    2013 "Stick part" extended to 11.3K years (last ice age; Holocene period)
       temperatures rose and fell less than 1 Â°C
       1. Obliquity (Milankovitch) cycle: 41K years; earth tilt 22.1 and 24.5 (now 23.5)
            tilt decreasing --> helps cooling
       2. Precession (wobble) cycle: 25K years; now perihelion in winter;
            bigger seasonal changes in one hemisphere and smaller in the other
       3. Eccentricity cycle: 400K years (Venus and Jupiter interaction); 0 to 0.06;
            now 0.0167 (3.3% dist.diff.); shorter cycles 96K,127K years

            Ice age period ~ 100K year (ocean sediments & ice cores)
   Republicans, James Inhofe/Joe Barton OK/TX: climate hoax;
     scientific facts by majority vote
     Jurassic Park/State of Fear Michael Crichton (MD) invited to testify in Congress
     Crichton's "State of Fear" required reading for panel
     "Merchants of Doubt" documents tobacco to climate misinformation
   2009: climate change deniers release embarrassing emails of climate scientists
     --> "Climate gate" to intimidate & prevent further research

7. Wind of Change
  1641 Thermometer invented by Ferdinand de Medici of Tuscany (Galileo's student)
  1654+ 11 station temperature readings by Jesuit monks;
    Catholic church only bible could be used to interpret nature - 9 stations shut down
  1659+ English temperature recording started - longest continuous
  1743+ Boston, Rio de Janeiro 1832+, Tanzania 1927+
  Antarctic cores --> CO2 40% higher than previous 800K years
  Holocene: current geologic epoch - started 11,650 after last glacial period
    next ice age in 10K to 50K years
  Beryllium-10: 1/2 life 1M years - proxy for solar activity
  11 year sunspot cycle (400 year records)- small effect on climate
  Maunder minimum: 1645-1715 sunspots were very rare - little ice age
  Medieval Warm Period: 900-1250
    both did not exist everywhere; global warming does...
  Volcanoes: SO2 --> H2SO4
    Philippine volcano Pinatubo 1991 - 22 mile high plume global temperature -1F for 15 months - in tree record
  Noodle --> hockey stick --> spaghetti temperature  reconstructions
    current 0.5F warmer than medieval warm period
    Every year since 2000 has been warmer than 2000
  Drought hockey stick does not exist - rainfall is variable
  In Morocco, temperature average similar 600 miles apart, rainfall very different.
  North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO) oscillation of Azores/Iceland High/Low
    (anticyclone/cyclone) air pressure: large --> small difference
    Strong Icelandic low --> wet British climate
    Strong Azores high --> western Europe drought
      Drought reconstruction: low latitude trees or stalagmite layers
        Morocco cedars & Scottish stalagmite: 1,000 years of inverse relation of rainfall
        ---> 1,000 years of NOA
        Strong NOA (high winds from Atlantic) --> medieval warm period
          --> European agriculture & population expansion
        Nature rejected paper but Science published it

8. Winter is coming
   Irish monks --> Irish Annals (431-1649): volcano explosions --> cold winters
   2018 drought exposed hunger stone: "If you see me weep" in German
   Mer de Glace (Alps sea of ice): sub-fossil trees in moraines as glacier retreats
     Trees killed by Little Ice age, starting at 1600
     Chamonix: very cold, people poor & illiterate  --> no lawyers , no clocks...
   350 years warm weather --> crusaders, Gothic cathedrals, Norse in Greenland &
     Newfoundland, vine yards in Britain; all unraveled after ~1450
   --> Deterministic connection of climate & history
   Cold climate; good things:
     1. Pieter Bruegel the Elder: Hunters in the snow (1565).....
     2. Mary Shelley's Frankenstein (1816- year without summer; Indonesians Tombora)
   Cold winters 1345-1355 --> 95 Norse farms in Greenland abandoned & Inuit thrived
     came to Orkney islands Scotland

9. 3 tree-ring scientists walk into a bar
   Oldest ice core from Allan Hills in Antarctica: 2.7 million years
   Sediments layers: one layer: 5, 10,.... 1,000 years
   Stalagmites & trees of oceans: coral clams, fish ear bones: 1 layer per year
   Sclerochronology from ocean quahogs --> 1357 year chronology
     500 year old Hafrum (mystery of ocean in Icelandic), like Prometheus,
     killed to date it.
   60 year otolith history of rockfish & seabird eggs: Pacific high pressure --> southern current
   2012-2016 California drought ("Ridiculously Resistant Ridge")
   Blue oak thin tree rings (700 year hydro-climate) <--> thick otoliths of rockfish
     2015 0 snow water equivalent in Nevada - 1941-2014 26.5 in average
     Blue oak rings --> snow levels in Sierra Nevada; 2015 was 500 year low
       no hockey stick in snow pack graph
   Paletempestology: study past storms through rings
     slash pines in Florida keys: 400 out of 44 hurricanes caught in tree rings
     --> 300 year hurricane history
     4,000 ship wreck catalog; July-November 1495-1825: 657 lost ships
     rings <--> shipwrecks  --> 500 year hurricane history
     Shipwreck gap (1645-1715) <--> Maunder (sunspot) minimum  (1672â€“1699)
       less solar radiation --> lower water temp --> fewer shipwrecks
       75% hurricane reduction --> climate models benchmarks
       --> historical/political  impacts
       --> 1650-1720 golden age of piracy:
         Edward "Black-beard" Teach, "Black Sam" Belamy, Anne Bonny (Irish),
         Mary Read, John "Calico Jack" Rackham (pirate flag)
           no "shiver me timbers" --> pirate success
             fake pirate oath; ship timbers shook in storms
   30 climate models: with global warming, fewer but more intense hurricanes

10. Ghosts, Orphans, and Extraterrestrials
   "Ghost forests": standing dead tree trunks; typical in coastal regions;
      Northwest 9.2 earthquake killed western red cedars in 1700 in Washington
        dated with last unearthed root ring;
        orphan tsunami (WO earthquake) hit Japan 10 hours later
          Peaceful Edo shogunate (1603-1867): no fighting --> samurai as scribes
        geomorphological data over 3.5K years: 1 earthquake/500 years
    Chernobyl accident killed all trees within 1.5 miles (red forest)
      merging/dividing cells in tree rings (sampled 23 years later)
      Similar anomalies in Tunguska 1908; meteorite exploded 3 to 6 mile altitude
        5 mile diameter of scorched trees, butterfly pattern 43/34 mile wings/body
    Flood rings: smaller early-wood vessels
      Mississippi flood reconstruction: channelization after 1927 great flood
        --> flooding is worse; no policy change
    Frost rings: irregular cells in California & Colorado bristle-cone pines:
      1815 Tambura eruption in Indonesia  --> 1817 frost (1816 Frankenstein story)
      1912 Katmai eruption in Alaska
      1963 Agung eruption in Bali Indonesia --> 1965 frost
      Tropical eruptions --> 2 year world wide cooling
        --> fluctuations in hockey stick/spaghetti; blade from 1990's stands out
    SO4 is Antarctica/Greenland ice core/tree rings perfect line up to 500BC to 1250;
      eruption --> cooling after 2 years
      Before 1250 eruption --> 7 year tree/ice core discrepancy
        Spike of C-14 in ring of Cryptomeria Japonica (cedar) at 775 AD
        775 C-14 is worldwide --> solar super-flare
        Ice core Beryllium-10 peak at 768 AD Antarctica/Greenland ice cores
          fixing 7year error --> tree rings/ice core align on volcanic events to 500BC
        Nilo-meter readinga 622 to 1902 <--> dated ice-cores:
          volcanos eruptions --> 9 in less water
        Volcano eruptions --> revolts in Ptolemaic Egypt (305BC-30BC);
          207BC 20-year revolt after the 209BC Icelandic eruption
            207BC famine in China
          Rosetta (discovered in Rashid) stone in Memphis: 3-language decree at 196 BC;
            decrees often in eruption years to establish authority
          30BC end of Ptolemic (suicide of Cleopatra after Rome victory)
            after major eruptions 46 & 44 BC --> famine , plague, corruption, migration
    775 solar flare: 40x to 50x any observed; largest in 11K years
      recorded as crucifix after sunset
      smaller Be-10 spike at 997
      Be-10 1/2 life 1.5 M years; from neutron spallation (breakup) of oxygen and nitrogen
    Humans/environment interconnections; examples: Egypt/Rome

11. Disintegration or fall of Rome
  8.5K tree ring samples: sub-fossil, historic buildings, Roman water wells
    living trees: 405BC-2008 temperature reconstruction
    Most trees cut 300BC to 200AD - Roman Climate Optimum (benign climate)
      250AD dry/cold started - 285AD west/east split
        485 German invasion
    Time of fall: 1M Rome residents, 35K administrators, 500K army, 1K cities
      dependent on farmland - optimized for luxury (olives...) not grains
    Migration period (250-410AD): Saxon, Frank, Visigoth infiltration
      they were fleeing Huns from Asia
    2.4K Tibetan climate history from 800 year Qilian juniper & wooden coffins
      --> sever drought in 400s  --> Hun expansion
    Roman villa destroyed 400s--> infant cemetery 650s:
      47 infants died of malaria (bad air) -> magic (in Christian times):
        severed puppy head, raen talon, toad bones, vampire burial (rock in mouth)
      Malaria late summer early fall --> poorer harvest
    Late Antique Little Ice Age (536-660):
      536 extreme cold; Irish annals: failure of bread.
       Mesopotamia : wine of reject grapes, sun became dark
       Tree rings --> 3.4-5.8F colder summers
       Reduced C14 (less solar radiation)
       Cause: unknown high latitude volcano eruption
         540 Ilopango eruption in El Salvador -larger than 1816 Tambora
           Bubonic plague:
             Yersinia pestis bacteria, fleas, gerbils, marmots, black rats
             541 infected grain in Egypt
             542/544 in Constantinople/Britain
             740s end of plague
             Global trade --> Justinian's plague
               Roman ships, cities, granaries --> pandemic plague
             50-60% mortality
             Islamic conquests in 650
             Resilient East Roman empire flourished in around 1,000
         547 less massive eruption
         550 switch to a negative North Atlantic Oscillation
            Iceland/Azores low/high: increased rain fall in Asia
              --> more gerbils/marmots --> more bubonic spread

12. It's the end of the world as we know it
  Khorgo volcano in Mongolia: lava bubble basalt yurts
    Siberian pines  657-present
    Genghis Khan 1206-1227; 1211-1225 widest rings; wettest period in 1,000 years
      --> pluvial (increased rain) --> horses flourished
      Before pluvial, drought & social unrest
  Empires thrived on good climate.
  Bad climate, depending on culture, empires decline.
  Threat of global warming known. but have no will to act.
  Uighur replaced Turks - empire 744-840AD (744-782 mild wet climate)
    Horse/silk trade with China; 783 start of 68 year drought;
    839: catastrophic cold winter --> Kirghiz invaded & killed Uighur emperor
      cold winter from historical record (not from tree rings)
  Angkor in Khmer empire (Cambodia): suburbs, extensive hydraulic network
    leveraged monsoons
    Vietnamese cypress (po mu): monsoon reconstruction 1250-2008
      --> fall of Angkor 1431 after 35 year severe drought
    Angkor Wat (temple city): 401 acre Buddhist monastery dedicate to Vishnu
      largest religious structure in world - threaten by tourism/development
  Maya classic period 250-750AD, Terminal Classic period 90-99% people lost
    current 6-7 million people
    Long Count calendar: world created 31 August 3114BC
    1,000 old Montezuma bald cypress (related to Sequoia) 50 miles of Mexico city
      37.5 ft diameter - largest in world
      771-2008 chronology: 4 severe droughts: 897-922 end of Maye
        1149-67 end of Toltecs (Aztec ancestors)
        1514-39 end of Aztec (1519-21 Spaniard war)
          European/African smallpox/measles --> 80-90% population reduction
          cocoliztli (pestilence) hemorrhagic fevers transmitted by rodent hosts
            and aggravated by extreme drought conditions.
            24 years after Spanish conquest
            cause: Salmonella Paratyphi C (common in Africa/Asia)
          alternating dry/wet --> epidemics (Hantavirus in southwest mice; 35% mortality)
          Aztec "Curse of One Rabbit": at "one rabbit" year first of the 52 yr cycle
            famine & pestilence; 10/13 "one rabbit" years preceded by drought
            none after 1454 - pestilence wiped out rabbits

13. Once upon a time in the West
  Chaco canyon 15x1 miles: pueblo Bonita: 2 acres, 4 stories, 650 rooms
    Visually identify thin/thick rings (1351,4,8/1259) --> quickly date 100K samples
    trees cut with stone axes 50 miles to west & south
       100 years after Chaco canyon deserted; 100-200 year cycle:
         1. exploration 2. exploitation 3. disintegration
  1,000 archaeological sites, 500-1400AD  --> 4 tree harvest peaks
    1285 last desertion; moved south - overpopulation
      1276-1299 mega-drought - high density societies could not handle
    Desolated Chaco landscape is from over-exploitation
    Early/late wood measurements 1200s were winter droughts
  North American Drought Atlas: 0-2005AD 0.5 degree resolution in southwest
    http://drought.memphis.edu/NADA/animation/Animation.aspx
    similar for Europe, Asia, Australia
  Chaco & Mesa Verde mega droughts: Medieval Climate anomaly: 1.3F warmer than
    the Little Ice Age (more sunspots) ---> Viking expansion & English wines
  1922 Colorado River Compact based on 30 year data (1907-30 pluvial; 450 year
    record rainfall) - how to divide Colorado in 7 states
    16.5 MAF (million acre feet) /year;  1/4 acre-foot/year per family
      1.5MAF to Mexico
      7.5 to north of Lee Ferry north Arizona, 7.5MAF south
      But 1521-1976 average was 13.5 MAF (12M families less)
  Medieval mega-droughts in southwest larger & longer than current ones
    60 vs 20 years
    atmosphere warming, population growth, &  water over-allocation --> worst droughts...

14. Will the wind ever remember?
  Global warming; global weirding: category 5 hurricanes, polar vortex,
    "snowmaggedons"  in TX UK, Niagara, Alabama ...
  1976 coldest winter in Balkans but hottest summer in UK;
    jet stream moved from north to south
    [northwest/southeast] dipole for 300 years;
       summer/winter: [cold/hot]/[warm/cold]
       --> use tree rings in the two poles to reconstruct jet stream
  Polar vortex: low pressure & cold air in north pole;
    move south as jet stream meanders north/south
  jet stream: slower & wavier --> more extreme weather
  Balkan/British tree rings for 290 years  --> jet stream latitude
    --> jet stream variance on rise since 1960s; more extreme north/south
  "Heart of darkness": topic of Cancer/Capricorn (crab/goat horn) :+23/-23 latitude
    green belt of tropics
      +/-30 subtropical desserts: Sahara, Atacama, Sonora...
        (the "horse latitudes" - ships WO wind dumped horse cargo)
  Wet/dry bands: Hadley circulation: warm tropical air rises 10 miles moves north/south poles
    Latitudes at which cool dry tropical air sinks has widened
      Tuscon 32.2, San Diego 32.7, Melbourne 37.8, Perth 32, Adelaide 35
        at risk of loosing rainfall
  Tropics expand 1/2 degree (35 miles) / 10 years  (models have less)
  Tree rings 35 to 45 latitude: movement of tropical edge from 1203 to present
    --> 1568-1634 tropical expansion (La Nina years);
      China: 1586-1589 & 1627 drought: --> famine & peasant rebellion
        1638-41: extreme drought; Yellow River dried up, people ate each other
          locusts, Manchu invasion, Ming collapse, 40% population reduction
      Turkey: 1590s droughts; Celali rebellion, Austria war, 1/3 population loss
      America: southwest pueblos abandoned, 1550-90 Chichimeca war (silver, natives, Spanish)
        1576 cocoliztli (hemorrhagic fever) Mexico epidemic ~15M deaths (-60%)
          (smallpox ~8M deaths)
        1587 North Carolina 115 men Roanoke colony --> at 1590 deserted
          1586-89 worst drought in 800 years
        1609-1610 Jamestown -80% depopulation
  El Nino Southern Oscillation (ENSO): warming of easter Pasific; most power climate driver
    every 2-7 years westbound winds weaken
    happens in December - effects summer
    Wet/dry south-America/Australia-Asia; opposite for El Nina
    Nino Teleconnection: more hurricanes in Caribbean in El Nina years
      Mount Lemmon AZ (9,159 ft; 2, 790 m) skiing in El Nino years
      northern tropical belt contracts in El nino
    Tree ring 1301-2005 ENSO reconstruction agrees with coral record
  Volcano eruption --> El Nino --> northern tropical edge contraction
    --> wetter/drier northern/east Asia climate
    2015-2016 El Nino strongest in 50 years --> Asia drier more dengue (mosquitoes)
  Solar radiation management: artificial volcanoes; inject aerosols into stratosphere
    reduce global warming - cheaper than other options
    does nothing to ocean acidification
    helps some and hurts others

15. After the Gold Rush
  California: 2018 November Camp fire destroyed Paradise and killed 86 people
     2020 August Complex fire burned 417K hectares (4G m2=4K km2=64kmx64km; 1 are = 100 m2)
       year total 1.8M hectares 18K km2
  surface fire: low intensity, scars large trees, every 5 to 10 years
    clears "fuel ladder" & prevent fire from reaching canopy
    lingers uphill burning bark --> "cat face"; same spot gets burned later
    tree rings --> mark spring/summer/fall
  Fire scar chronologies --> https://ipn.paleofire.org/
    oldest fire: 1,125BC from giant sequoia
    1900s rings are free of scars --> US forest management;
      after 1910 great fire: Idaho Montana  1.2M hectare (12K km2) killed more than 100
  Smokey fire effect: frequent fires to no fires --> from surface to canopy fires
    fire deficit:  zero tolerance --> destructive fires
      extended fire season: droughts, more fuel load (dead trees) --> destructive fires
  fire history <--> wet+drought history (+land-use)
    2,3 El Nino + 1 El Nina = Fuel + drought = big fire (published 1990)
  Sierra Nevada (land-use)
  fire history (no El Nino):
    1. Pre 1776 (missions) Indigenous, moderate fires (22%), cause:
         indigenous (500-600 tribes) patch burning
           burn blue oak to start eatable Hall's Mule Ears
    2. 1776-1865 Missions, extreme fires (38%), cause:
         85% indigenous died from smallpox pandemic - patch burning decreased
         1829: biggest fire year
    3. 1865-1904 Gold rush, few fires (20%), cause:
         Coloma gold 1848, close to Sacramento --> 300K immigrants
           1862: 3M sheep grazed fire fuel
         Logging for houses & railroads; stumps in remote locations
    4. 1904+ Smokey Bear, very little fire, cause:
         Forest Service
    LESSON: land use modulates climate vs fires
       --> create mosaic-like forest to reduce fuel

16. Forest for the trees
  Thermoluminescence Dating: Radiation knocks electrons in minerals from ground state
    When heated over 500C electrons give off light; 40K-200K (C-14/K,Arg)
    flint fragments accumulate energy, pretreated & heated give off light
    wooden spears in Schoningen coal mine 340K-300K yr old - oldest artifact
    Homo heidelbergensis hominids
  Earliest construction from wood 9K BC in North Yorkshire
  Human civilization age is founded on tress
  Blank spots on tree-ring map:
    Easter Island (Rapa Nui)
      1200 had 20 tree species (pollen in sediment) --> 1722 not one tree
      1400-1680 900 Maoi carved from volcanic tuff; transported with wood
    Iceland 857 Norse came 25% forest covered
      in 300 years Norse cut down all trees
      Now 1% forest covered despite reforestation...
   Epic of Gilgamesh 3,000BC Iraq, in "forest Journey" cuts forest of cedars
   Greece --> Italy (Rome) --> Spain nearly deforested
   Monegros dessert in Spain from making Spanish Armada 1580's
   1200's England, France, Belgium, Netherlands imported Baltic wood
   1400's Venice set up forest conservation for ships & levees
   In Belgium Romans wiped out the charcoal forest
   Industrial revolution:
     Belgium spruce reforestation
     England coal (had no trees)
       coke (refine coal) for iron production
     trees --> coal --> oil & gas
     emission of millions year worth of Carbon
   Fossil fuels: million-year-scale carbon cycle (atmosphere/land/ocean)
     Carbon released slowly via weathering & metamorphism
   Atmosphere carbon cycle:
     1. photosynthesis; plants
     2. perspiration; animals/plants
   Burning fossils --> far reaching impacts;
     Anthropocene epoch:
       possible starts:
        1. 8,000 years ago (farming/deforestation)
           author of Plows, Plagues, Petroleum
             (Ruddiman Hypothesis)
             small dips in CO2 caused by plagues (less people, more forests)
        2. 2,000 years ago (big civilizations Rome, China)
        3. end of WWII o
           WWII --> sych globalization, industrialization, population growth
             --> radioactive, fossil-fuel, plastic pollution
        4. 1965 - C14 peak in tree rings - 2 years after nuclear test ban
           RXBarsfound in World's loneliest tree;
            Sitka spruce planted in Campbell island New Zealand at 1900
        5. Plastiglomerate: (2006) quasi rock of melted plastic debris sand basalt... (in campfires)
  21 century: deforestation 30% of green house effect
  Afforestation & reforestation in Europe since 1800
    need on global scale
  Carbon fertilizRXBarsation: euphemism of carbon dioxide
    does not work; nitrogen / phosphorus / water limits
    risky - fires, pests..
    not possible - 7.5 billion people to feed
  Dendrochronologists:
    understand past societies/climates
    discover global warming adaptation
    can find Carbon storage versus species, time, soil, climate
    collaborate with:
      foresters
      ecologists
      geographers - earth/atmosphere/human activity
      sociologists
      anthropologists
      biogeochemists - physical/biological life-cycle of elements
      atmospheric scientists
