THIRTEEN GORILLAS --------------------------------------------------------------
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
zoonosis: animal infection (bacterium, virus, fungi, protist, parasite or prion) transmissible to humans
cause: 1. food/water, 2. farming/livestock 3. wild animals 4. insects 5.pets  6. exhibition
              7. hunting 8. deforestation 9.climate change 10 .secondary transmission
Darwin: man connected with other animals in origin,descent, sickness and health.
anthroponosis: spillover from humans to non-humans; via gorilla tourism

zoonosis (60% of human infections): ebola, bubonic plague, flu, monkey pox, bovine tuberculosis,
  Marburg virus, rabies, hantavirus pulmonary syndrome, anthrax, Lassa virus, Rift Valley fever,
  scrub typhus, Bolivian hemorrhagic feve
  r, Kyasanur forest disease, Nipah encephalitis,
  ocular larva migrants, toxocariasis, AIDS, Hendra, Machupo, Hantaan, Junin, Borna,
  Simian foamy virus, Lyme, West Nile fever
  70+/30 from wildlife/domestic animals

NOT zoonosis: Smallpox (variola virus), poliomyelitis, Streptococcus pyogenes, cholera, measles

Meningitis: brain/spinal cord membrane inflammation
Encephalitis: brain inflammation

Seroprevalence: population percent that tests positive for a specific disease
47% of bats had Hendravirus antibodies (Australia) , horse (non-native) highly susceptible.

Foot and mouth disease - high economic cost; low lethality, high morbidity (highly courageous)
via feces, milk, and aerosol. Pigs are amplifiers - spew 30x virus as cows.

Spillover cause:  Human 1.ecological pressure and disruptions 2. technology/behavior

Re-emergence of TB - via infectious AIDS patients.
Emergent disease: incidence rate increases after pathogen gets into a new host
Spillover: pathogen crosses form one host species to another
           (economic; event in one country effects the economy of another)

Anthropologist: we swapped ancient painfully acquired cultural knowledge with
                that dependence on disease scientists.

Ebola hype; nothing like the Crimean–Congo hemorrhagic fever

EVERYTHING COMES FROM SOMEWHERE ------------------------------------------------
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Measles virus is related to nipah and hendra viruses, hence has been zoonotic.
Measles in London had 18 month cycle; mass-action principle:
susceptible (newborns) times infectious;  rate of the chemical reaction is proportional
to the product of the activities or concentrations of the reactants

Malaria - 4 protists; Plasmodium falciparum is the worst; 36 day cycle:
   1. sporozoite asexual enters human from mosquito bite and goes to liver
   2. merozoite asexual emerges from liver and reproduces in red blood cells
   3. trophozoite feeds and grows inside blood cells
   4. schizont fattens and bursts releasing merozoite wand creates fever
   5. gametocyte sexual enter blood stream and picked up by mosquito
   6. ookinete fertilized lodges in mosquitoes gut, ripens into a bag or sporozietes
      which bursts and go to mosquitoes salivary glands.

p. falciparumis from a African gorilla zoonosis (genetic analysis) kills 500K/year
p. malariae if not treated can stay in blood liver for decades
ACGT Adenine, Cytosine,Guanine, Thymine

SIR model (Susceptible/Infected/Recovered) 1926; flu has no R (no immunity)
  dR/dt=γI
  dS/dt=-βIS/N
  dI/dt=βIS/N-γI; dI/dt+dR/dt+dS/dt=0 ; S+I+R=N (population)
SIRD model; D for deceased

Epidemic starts when density, infectivity, and death are right
Small changes in infectivity produce epidemics
Epidemic ends when susceptible density is too low

Drought increased malaria - stagnant instead of flowing water
19050's WHO program to eradicate malaria with DDT & medicine
turned science in a failed spray-gun war; underestimated missing one infected person
Basic reproductive rate 10 lowest
540 highest; a person is infectious for 80 days, with 10 bites/day

p. vivax zoonosis from Asian macaque
used to treat neurosyphilis (sensitive to temperature)
malaria therapy saved tens of thousands of syphilis patients.
Treatment with p. knowlesi until 1945 - stopped after it became too virulent
1965 & 1990 macaque zoonosis of p. knowlesi in Malaysia
Human expansion is forcing p. knowlesi change hosts from macaque to humans
Chance, evolution, ecology determine epidemics

DINNER AT THE RAT FARM ---------------------------------------------------------
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
2002 man gets SARS China keeps secret documents
2003 SARS Hong Kong to Toronto, to 70 Chinese hospitals
Seafood merchant 1st super-spreader (poison king)
Doctor gets SAR from him and become a super spreader in Hong Kong.
Doctors/nurses in Singapore wore no masks for treating the atypical pneumonia/
people fined $300 for spitting; 200 infected, 33 died.

1997 Honk Kong bird H5N1 flu 18 infected 6 died 1.5 million chickens destroyed
New virus; cannot use PCR; no response in cells of HeLa, dog kidney, rat tumor,
lung of aborted fetus; succeeded with rhesus kidney cells.
Named it SARS-CoV not Guangzhou because of tourism.
Chinese discovered it first but were overridden that it was chlamydia.

Reservoir civet cat (mongoose like), In Guangdong Era of wild flavor (yewei)
Wild animal market: "microbial swap-meet" - every specie in land/air/water.
yewei is good luck ostentatious, gaining face.. in brothels, tiger penis
2,000 wild restaurants in Guangdong. In ten years wild animal sales increased
Snake possibly farmed, endangered turtles, civet farms, bred wild animals are tame

Total 8,000 infected ~800 died.  Chinese said civet cats not reservoir,
but after resurfacing in 2004, killed 1,000 civets
But horseshoe bats had antibodies, civets did not, they just amplified.
Eating bats? "people in china will anything that flies except a plane"
Era of Wild Flavor driven underground; people sill believe eating wild is healthy.
Symptoms appear before person becomes infectious; flu it is reversed

THE DEER THE PARROT AND THE KID NEXT DOOR --------------------------------------
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Parrot fever (psittacosis) 1880, similar to Lyme, Chlamydia psittaci zoonotic
From Argentina, to Australian parakeets - birds shed bacteria when stressed.
In Australia it was not reported.
Q fever (1930)caused by Coxiella burnetii; infects cats, dogs, sheep , cows, bandicoots
Q (Query) cause unknown, military stockpile until 1970
1 bacteria needed to infect 50% (ID50), like virus it intracellular hides from immune
system, large and small (airborne, highly durable) form.
Can live in salt water for 6 months; everywhere except in New Zealand.

2007 very dry April in Netherlands spread Q fever from a goat reservoir;
1984 after a swine flue, pigs replaced with goats.  epidemic lasted to 2009
12/3,500 died/infected, orphan lamb adopted for psychotherapy infecting 28 people.
Hay was added on top of old hay urine, manure for months.
50,000 goats killed

Parasite: internal predator. Transmission solved via massive replication, airborne
dispersal, environmentally resistant life-stages, behavioral influence on host,
using amplifier hosts, insect/spider vectors. Susceptible host density helps...

Lyme disease got political; "chronic Lyme is an illusion" advisory resulted
to antitrust investigation. reported in 1909; in Europe and Asia
"black-legged tick" was mistakenly split into new species: "deer tick";
reducing deer did not effect Lyme disease, tick has more than 100 hosts:
robins cows, squirrels, dogs, skinks, skunks...
Tick cycle is 2 years, early on questing is close to ground - shrews provide 30% of meals.
Ticks are born clean; 90% infected by white foot mice, shrews and chipmunks - forget deer!
mice and shrews are poor groomers.  Acorn crops more important than lawns...
Humans and deer are dead-end hosts.  1996, 2002 peaks were acorn bounties.
One mouse pair creates 50 to 790 mice.

Lyme protection thru diversity; owls, foxes,... to control mice
Small woodland in cities not diverse,less safe; white footed mice are more common.
"all life is connected" is vague - how is the important part.
Borrelia burgdorferri resists antibiotic by becoming a round body;
unlike Coxiella burnettii (Q fever) not airborne.

GOING VIRAL---------------------------------------------------------------------
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1890 tobacco virus not filterable, efficacy not effected by diluting it;
1898 foot-and-mouth virus virus; 1901 yellow fever virus, kill mosquitoes in Cuba
15 to 300 nm, 2K to 1.2M nucleotides (3B for mouse) 3nuc./amino acid, 250 amino acid/protein
"bad news wrapped in a protein"
DNA polymerase repairs DNA - mutations are low.  RNA most bad viruses wo repairing
mutations 1,000 higher; rate is capped because they can be lethal to virus.
Virus reservoir has no symptoms; ecological equilibrium.

herpes B virus; (B initial of person died) minor to macaques by 70% lethal to humans
Researches died while working on polio and HIV - latest on in 1997
Herpes B, Ebola, Marbug, Crimean-Congo are BSL4.

Simian foamy virus (SFV) foam like cell fusing - no disease but used as marker for the big one.
Human foamy virus (HFV) "a retro virus in search of disease".
AIDS 30 million deaths, if airborne most people would have been dead, airborne rabies...
Polio, an enterovirus, follows a mouth fecal route.

Transmission: 1. vertical (mother to child), oral-fecal, blood-borne, sexual, saliva
Virulence: complicated, host.pathogen evolution.
Pathogenicity: capacity to cause disease, latent infection is ideal parasitism.

1859 wild rabbits freed in Australia, 1950 600 million.  Poxivirus (via myxoma) killed 99.6%
within 2 weeks.  After 10 years rabbits rebounded; evolution lowered virulence;
evolution improved mutual tolerance to 90%, ofaverage “spreadability”  3 strains one became dominant in 1980.


Pathogen rule #1: not "do not kill your host", but "do not burn bridges before you cross them".
Viruses evolve as if they are alive
May/Anderson improve the SIR model made N variable;
R0 = βN/(α + b + γ)    - this is not correct (unit analysis)
  R0 average “spreadability”; number infections from one infected person
  1.(β) transmission rate,
  2.(γ) recovery rate - infected recover and become susceptible,
  3.(α) virulence; host mortality rate
  4.(b) uninfected mortality rate
  5.(Ν) host population
no one has been vaccinated / has had the disease before
no way to control the spread
From the rabbit myxoma,  host-parasite balance does not mean small harm to host.

RNA virus: most common/evolvable/emerging pathogen, every living cell may support at least one.
DNA viruses too stable; Varicella zoster (chicken pox), hides and comes back as shinges
they use DNA polymarase for replication;
Small RNA genome -> high mutations, high mutations -> small genome (bad replication); Eigens paradox.
RNAs have no long-term security but able to adapt or jump species(zoonosis).

CELESTIAL HOSTS ---------------------------------------------------------------------
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Viruses jump from safe hosts or sometimes where gotten stuck
rodents -> hantaviruses, lassa
squirrels -> monkey pox
macaques -> Herpes B
birds to chickens/pigs -> flu
sheep/goats(?) -> measles
chimpanzees -> HIV-1
bats(pigs/horses...amplifiers) -> Hendra, Marburg, SARS-CoV, rabies, Duvenhage,
         Kyasanur Forrest, Ebola(?), Melaka, Australian bat lyssavarius, Nipah
Nipah confused with Japanese encephalitis (similar to dengue): one mile pig barking cough;
easy on pigs; human encephalitis; positive to Hendra antibodies but different.
Pig farmers fled, Nipah was a ghost town.  Pig herds rampaging in villages, army,
police, vet in PPE shooting pigs 1.1 million pigs;  6 soldiers infected.
End of epidemic, 283 infections 109 deaths (40%).  If it was not lethal to humans
it would not have bee
n noticed - there are unknown zoonosis!
"How may other Nipahs are going to Bethlehem to be born?"
Nipah found on water apples eaten by bats and in bat urine.

Nipah in Bangladesh 70% fatal - victims climbed trees, drank raw date-palm sap.
Unlike Malaysia, person-person spread.  2 liter of sap /tree sold for $0.24.
Sapper: "I get God's grace by birds chance to drink sap" and customer gets Nipah.
Moore opportunities for a new host -> more chance of adapting to new immune system.
It is random - not emotive; the revenge of the forest.....
Ecology (human/animal contact) & evolution (no purpose; just results)

If one does not know about bats, he writes a review article.
25% of mammal species are bats.
Social bats; a million per colony; meet criteria of critical size; meas;es circulate in 500K or more.
20-25 lifespan helps R0 ∝(infection/contact)·(contact/time)·(time/infection)
In Uganda infected miners and tourists helped identify bats as reservoir of Marbug virus.

Metapopulation: population of populations;
  set of local populations connected by migrating individuals.
  Large population of single species is most stable when divided into sub-populations

If virus goes through an isolated population (<500K for measles) may become extinct.
Virus avoids this if it infects one isolated population at a time.
Greater population isolation, more time for the virus to return,
more time for susceptibles to be born, and the larger the outbreak.
Australian bats have become more isolated, hence virus is more abundant.

Avian flu H5N1; haemagglutinin (H) and the neuraminidase (N) spikes;
H hooks to receptors of victim cells, N removes receptors of infected cells to all spread.
17 types of H, 9 types of N.
H1N1 1918 (2%), H2N2 1957(0.6%), H3N2 1968 (0.2%); H1N1/H3N2 seasonal flu.
H5N1 60% lethal and poorly transmissible.
Reported regularly in Cambodia, China, Egypt, Indonesia, Thailand, Vietnam.
H5N1 can become a big and fast killer - WHO tries to ensure that H5N1 does not infect chickens.

Nipah had person to person transmission in 2004; 36/27 infections/deaths.
Why obsess about zoonoses, plenty of cholera...,: AIDS.

THE CHIMP AND THE RIVER --------------------------------------------------------
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Aids infections with fungal pneumonia and oral candidiasis - Candida in babies & diabetics
Low T-cell count, and Kaposi's sarcoma (human Herpesvirus 8).
First known case 1977 doctor in Zaire.

8 groups of HIV-2: A-H, A/B prevalent, 4 of HIV-1  -> 12 spillovers
HIV trend - not a fluke.
Retrovirus converts its RNA into DNA and infects the nucleus; virus replicates
when the host cell replicate - causes cancer.
First know human retrovirus: T-cell leukemia (HTLV).
Discovery squabble: money, ego, national pride, Nobel prize, test patent lawsuit

Work in cancer causing viruses -> simian immunodeficienty virus (SIV) in sick macaques
African green monkeys was the reservoir, Found virus close to SIV (NOT HIV) in a prostitute.
HIV-2 symptoms similar to HIV-1; less transmissible and virulent.

SIV reservoir African sooty mangabey (sm), captivity infected Asian macaques (am)
Three SIV variants: 1. (sm), 2. (am) 3. African green monkeys (afg)
(sm) and (am) close to HIV-2 hence (sm) infected humans
SIV zoonosis from mangabey to humans and evolved as HIV-2.

HIV-1 in 1959 & 1960 tissue, suspect early as 1908.

1. Cut-hunter hypothesis: butcher monkey contacted a wound; blood-blood contact.
2. Contaminated oral polio vaccine (OPV) tested in Africans - bacterial/bacterial has happened;
1861 smallpox vaccine in Italy from sores resulted to syphilis.
1900+ 9 children died from smallpox vaccine that had tetanus.
Diphtheria antitoxin (from horses)with tetanus killed 17 children.
Vaccine were filtered for bacteria, but Polio vaccine (10 to 30%) contaminated
with SV40 (simian vacuolating virus); SV40 causing cancer is false.
Formaldehyde used to kill viruses in vaccines.

Koprowski polio vaccine (1958) grown virus in chimpanzee kidney cells instead of monkey kidney cells.
HIV-1 is iatrogeric (generated by medical treatment). Some chimps had SIV.
Molecular clock analysis put common ancestor of DRC60 and ZR59 at 1908 zoonosis of HIV-1.

2002 SIVcpz found in 1 out of 58 central chimps urine in Gombe national park; chimps used to humans;
Goodall study. Urine collection outside park would not work.
Chemical RNAlater preserved RNA and antibodies in un-refrigerated feces.
From feces found SIVcpz very close HIV-1 in southeastern Cameroon.

Brazzaville, Congo in 1914 had hundreds of servant/prostitutes (low risk HIV)
Leopoldville (Kinshasa) across the river had more; 1940 to 1960 grew 10x.
Ebola and HIV-1 in the same location.

Ape parts are consumed as part of a local 13 year old boy beka ceremony.
Use gorilla arms when chimps not available.
Spillover could be from the ritual of hunger.

Automatic weapons from wars reduced chimp populations after 2002.
AIDS education is safe sex, in Africa it is "do not eat apes"
1st HIV-1 infection: SIV virus latched to the CD4 receptors of T-cells
converted its RNA too DNA, infected the nucleus - T-cell divides new virions created

Legal smoked monkey in Central Republic of Africa $6,  chimps illegal; secret arangement
Wild critter sink: Quesso in 1990's 12,600 pounds of mammal wild meat per week.

Chimp got AIDS 10 years after being infected with HIV-1.
Cut-hunter -> cut-chimp hypothesis Chimp could have gotten SIV from eating a monkey.
SIV from which HIV-a came is lethal to monkeys.

Treatment for trypanosomiasis (sleeping sickness; tsetse fly) in Cameroon -
36 injections for 3 years; malaria leprosy...  being jabbed in style
lot of patients few syringes... 3.9M injections most intravenous
Syringe spread of HIV-a highly likely but not provable.
Syphilis treated with arsenic/bismuth injections.

1960 Congo becomes independent Belgians leave, Haitian teachers doctors (French speaking)
help Congo and get HIV-1. Plasma trade in Haiti increased spread; plasmapheresis machine
can infect donor.  This also happened in Mexico and China.
American company paid $3/liter, exporting 6K liter/month to US in 1972.

20 year-old sample from 1980 of a Haitian had HIV-1 group M sub-type B - spread to
US, Europe Japan, Australia... One person or infected bottle brought to US in 1969
1981 was first patient with pneumonia and oral fungus.

IT DEPENDS --------------------------------------------------------
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Population outbreak: sudden increase of single species; lemmings, only some kind
of mouse and starfish,tent caterpillars, gypsy moths...
Most serious outbreak is homo sapiens; 1960 3 billion, then 1 billion/13 years
On 6 billion we exceeded by 100 times the biomass of any large wild animal that
has ever existed. 1.3 billion cows are more massive then us...

Caterpillar outbreaks  5 to 11 year cycle; one cause is infectious disease.
Nuclear polyhedrosis virus (NPV) melts gypsy moth caterpillars -epizootic (animal
epidemic), Could humans have a caterpillar-like cycle?

Typical flu 3M infections/year, 250K deaths/year. 4 types; species/genus:
  A: aquatic birds reservoir; most severe to young/old, occasional pandemic
  B: primarily in humans; seals, horses, pigs, dogs; effects children
  C: similar to B; asymptomatic; pigs, dogs, camels, cattle
  D: cattle reservoir; humans, horses, camels, goat, sheep; no human disease
2020 flu vaccine:
  A/Hawaii/70/2019 (H1N1)pdm09-like virus (updated)
  A/Hong Kong/45/2019 (H3N2)-like virus (updated)
  B/Washington/02/2019 (B/Victoria lineage)-like virus (updated)
  B/Phuket(Thailand)/3073/2013-like (Yamagata lineage) virus.
2019how doe=h flu vaccine:
  A/Brisbane/02/2018 (H1N1)pdm09-like virus;
  A/Kansas/14/2017 (H3N2)-like virus;
  B/Colorado/06/2017-like virus (B/Victoria lineage).
  B/Phuket/3073/2013-like virus (B/Yamagata lineage)

Flu; 3 RNA viruses; 8 segments,  templates for 11 proteins, 2 of which are spike:
hemagglutinin(H) & neuraminidase(N1) ;flu H5N1.. 5,1 are sub-types;
16/9 H/N types detected in nature

1918 flu killed 50M, ~600K in US; identified in 2005 to be H1N1. Reservoir are aquatic birds.
1961 H5N3 flu kills terns in South Africa and wedge tailed shearwaters.
Most bird infections are gastrointestinal - fecal-oral spreading.
H7N7 infects horses, Pigs get human and avian flu, most flu comes from domestic animals.

1997 18 H5N1 (avian) Honk Kong cases with 33% deaths; source was live chicken market.
1.5M chickens culled.  Ducks is the Trojan horse; some species infected without symptoms.
2003 H5N1 in South Korea, Vietnam,Japan, Indonesia, China.
2005 6K wild goose, shelducks, cormorants, gull, died from H5N1 in Quinhai lake in China
2006 H5N1 got to Egyptian poultry via ducks; 151 infections 52 deaths

Highest H5N1 cases: 1.Egypt 2.Indonesia 3.Vietnam 4.China/Cambodia
H5N1 is epizootic (an epidemic in non-humans) and panzootic (effect different animals)
If H5N1 ever gets person-person transmission...

Preparations:
  1. Detect spillover in remote places before they become outbreaks
  2. Organizational capacity to control outbreaks
  3. Tools to quickly detect and characterize new viruses
  4. Ability to quickly create a vaccine

Germ disease & evolution theories was a neat and sterile historical coincidence.
Neat for providing insight, and sterile because we did not connect them.
1894 bubonic plague in Honk Kong traced to rats, via rat fleas.
Pasteur created rabies vaccine in 1885; from spinal cord of rabbit died of rabies

Malaria and yellow eradication failed, smallpox succeeded.
Small pox was simple - no reservoir host and no vector.
Polio eradication started in 1988, for malaria in 2007 by Bill Gates (!)

Zoonotic diseases tell us that we are part of nature.

Transmission depends on variable (heterogeneity) animal or human behavior.
A caterpillar may inherit behavior to avoid virus smear, human not to eat chimps,
wear mask,...
