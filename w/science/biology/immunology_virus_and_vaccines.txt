IMMUNOLOGY______________________________________________________________________
    antigen   causes production of antibodies; binds to antibody or T-cell or B-cell
              chemical, bacteria, virus, pollen, food, tumor, normal protein (autoimmune disease)
    adjuvant  person/thing that helps;
              radiation, or substance to improve treatment
              added to immunogen to get more immune response
    immunogen substance that generates immune response
              specific antigen; small molecule antigens are not immunogens
    T-cell    lymphocyte (white blood cell), created in bone & Thymus gland,
              person has a billion different T-cells,
              attacks infected cells
    B-cell    lymphocyte (discovered in Bursa of Fabricius organ in birds)
              person has 10 billion different B-cells,
              clean up after T-cells and for the antigen creates antibodies,
              attacks antigen before cell infection
    antibody  or immunoglobulin; tags antigen or infected cell, or eliminates antigen,
    globulin  protein soluble only in mild salt solution,
              all blood proteins, except albumin, are globulins,
    allergy   hypersensitivity to an antigen,
              B-cells produce too much IgE antibodies

    Favorites cell types (from the Atlantic)
      Innate immune
        1. neutrophils - selfless; first to fight and die
        2. macrophages - adorable - eat and belch microbes alone
        3. dendritic   - like macrophages but talk and hang out together;
                        winner of best immune cell contest
      Adaptive immune
        1. B-cells - hide in tissues, too good at their job, compete among themselves
                     selfish;self-involved snobs
        2. T-cells - thyme(T); cytotoxic T cells, intriguing without romance
                     create antibodies (soldiers that stick to virus)
        2. Helpers - Help B cells
                     benign Jekyll (vs T-cell Hyde)


VIRUS___________________________________________________________________________
    Ideal virus: 1. replication gene
                 2. virulence - deal with host defense
                 3. structure gene - capsid/envelope/spike

    SARS-CoV-2: 30,000 nucleotides, 30 genes (1,000 nucl./gene; 1 protein/gene)

    Variants: mutations may effect:
       virus transmission
       virus virulence
       immune escape - structure gene changes and antibodies do not work,
                       not easy; requires a lot of mutations

    Critical Community Size (CSS): max size of host population without a repeating
             endemic; or measles 500K; transmission efficiency, lifelong immunity...
             not applicable to zoonotic virus

VACCINES________________________________________________________________________
    1. Inactivated virus, use chemical to disable RNA
       For flu, polio, rabies

    2. Live attenuated; disable the virulence gene
      grow repeatedly in chicken embryos - virus looses
      virulence because it does not deal with immune system
      Now use genetic engineering to disable virulence genes
      For measles, smallpox, chickenpox, rotavirus, yellowfever

    3. Subunit, recombinant, polysaccharide, and conjugate
       piece of virus
       For shingles, whooping cough, HPV (human papillomavirus)

    4. Viral vector - 1. deactivated virulence gene
      2. with genetic engineering splice/add the structure protein
      of the virus that we want to immunize against
      most viral vectors most do not replicate
      For ebola, covid,flu, adenovirus (commonn cold)

    5. Toxoid (for bacteria)
       Protect against toxin not the bacteria
       For tetanus, diphtheria

    6. mRNA (or DNA) - only the structure gene in a lipid nano particle
       For covid

    All make protein for the immunogen - an antigen capable of inducing an
    immune response.  Immune system makes antibodies to attach/block the spike.
    T-cells are also involved.
