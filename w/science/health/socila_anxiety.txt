Social anxiety:
  Fear that we will not be accepted by pears;
  we are social animals - biological need to be liked.
  Normal.

Social anxiety --> Social anxiety disorder
  when distressing / interferes with life
  most common of anxieties/phobias, next to depression/drug abuse (13% people)
  overlaps with depression

  Distress: meeting people
            giving speech
            do things in front of people

  Coping: never marry
          few friends
          not go to parties
          (live isolated, but feel urgency)

  Symptoms: panic/anxiety attacks;
            run away from interview

Collectivist cultures:
  individual is not in the center, less common in Asian Americans
  Hispanic/African are in between

Feeling:
  dread, worry, no control, hold glass, look into ground
  ruminate & interpret more negative

Strategies:
  Cognitive behavioral therapy (75% response):
    Challenge maladaptive thinking by asking people to engage in exposure practices
    & realize that nothing bad is happening
  SSRI (Selective Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitor) antidepressants;
    antidepressants increase serotonin (“feel good hormone”)
    or eat salmon, eggs, spinach, and seeds to boost serotonin

Therapy:
  1. speak in front of the group
  2. 8th session worst case scenario:
     for rejection fear:
       got to restaurant and ask every woman for her number;
       "Hi I like your face, Would you like to go out with me?
       Would you like to give me your number?"
     for inconveniencing people:
       got to coffee shop spill coffee & say:
       "I like to have a new one"
       go to library and ask for a book on the joy of sex
     Do something over the top, violates their personal social norms
     and engages them to reevaluating maladaptive beliefs
       --> very successful
