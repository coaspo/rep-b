Problem: epidemic of 6-month old obesity because of sugar/fructose.
Started with Ancel Keys's faulty conclusion about fat.
Caffeine(diuretic) and salt in coke makes you more thirsty.
<b>Only liver can metabolize fructose (like alcohol it is poison-like)</b> -
it generates uric acid & increase systolic blood pressure.
If glycogen depleted, one needs fructose - applies only to athletes.
Obese intervention:
  1. No sugar drinks - only water & milk.
  2. Carbs with fiber.
  3. wait 20 min between servings.
Exercise not to burn calories, but to:
  1. improve skeletal muscle insulin sensitivity
  2. reduce stress/cortisol (stress==obesity)
  3. make TCA cycle run faster (release stored energy),
     <B>detoxify fructose</B> and improve insulin sensitivity.
In nature fructose comes with fiber!  Fruit is OK.
Eat fiber to:
  1. reduce carbohydrate absorption - fat or fart
  2. induce satiety
  3. prevent absorption of some fatty acids  which can suppress insulin
