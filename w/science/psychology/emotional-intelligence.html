<pre>Emotional intelligence (EI) :
  Ability to understand and manage your own emotions, and those of the people around you
  or capacity to reason about emotions and emotional information, and of emotions to enhance thought.

Caveat: EI is embraced by business community, but may no have predictive value; it may be
        used to help or manipulate.  It may reduce teamwork.
