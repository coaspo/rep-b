  Egoism: excessive concern with oneâ€™s own pleasure or advantage at the expense
          of community well-being.

  Greed: dissatisfaction of not having enough, combined with the desire to acquire

  Narcissism: ego-reinforcement; the all-consuming motive, leading to the tendencies

                             and is entitled to more than others.
