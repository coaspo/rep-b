Hypersanity (since 1967): free state of higher consciousness via "madness" as a voyage of discovery.
  
<i>Diogenes</i>:
  The most beautiful of all things is "uninhibited thought," "free speech," or "full expression."
  "I am looking for a human being" insinuating that people are not living up/aware of, their full human potential.
  Happiness has nothing to do with material circumstances.
  Humans learn from studying the simplicity/restlessness of dogs,
  which, unlike humans, had not complicated every simple gift of the gods.
  When asked where is he from: "I am a cosmopolitan (citizen of the world)"

Hypersanity implies that mere sanity is not all it‚Äôs cracked up to be; 
People have frequent sub-optimal/inappropriate verbal/behavioral response to the world.

Laing, mental illness dr.: "The condition of alienation, of being asleep, of being unconscious,
of being out of one‚Äôs mind, is the condition of the normal man. Society highly values its normal man.
It educates children to lose themselves and to become absurd, and thus to be normal.
Normal men have killed perhaps 100,000,000 of their fellow normal men in the last 50 years."

"normal" people suffer from not being hypersane: They have a restricted worldview, 
confused priorities, and are wracked by stress, anxiety, and self-deception.
Mysterious, magical life slips through their fingers.

Hypersane persons escaped from Plato‚Äôs cave of shadows were reluctant to crawl back down
and involve themselves in the affairs of men, may prefer to hide out in their back gardens.

C.G. Jung:
  Libido: Psychic energy motivates behaviors (spiritual, intellectual, creative).
          Seek pleasure and reduce conflict.
  Unconscious: Individual/ancestral repressed thoughts/memories/emotions
               Human mind has innate characteristics ‚Äúimprinted‚Äù from evolution.
               For example fear of the dark.
  Cause of behavior: past experiences and future aspirations
