Overload is: 40,000 products in grocery store.
            300 exabytes(10^18) of internet information
"The Organized Mind: Thinking Straight in the Age of Information Overload"
by: Daniel Levitin psychology professor.
1. Brain dump - clear mind;
   Clear list of things in your head
   Write down anything that interrupts your work flow.
   Once on paper organize: 1. do (today), 2. delegate, 3. defer (week), 4. drop 
2. 45 minute to do quick (2 min. or less) items
3. Clump together similar items, do not organize when cleaning.
   Do more and finish with more energy
4. Do not multitask - it forces you to decide.
   Decisions deplete glucose in the brain.
5. Limit distractions of email/phone.
6. Eat the frog (make decisions) in the morning when glucose is highest.
   ‚ÄúShould I use a blue or green pen?‚Äù draws from the same energy store as 
   ‚ÄúI‚Äôve just been diagnosed with cancer. Should I opt for radiation or surgery?‚Äù
   Do whatever is the most unpleasant thing.
7. Spend as much time on decisions/tasks as they are worth it.
   organize but do not go crazy.
8. Take 15 min break - walk, nap, music - every 2 hours.
   Increases IQ by 10 points.
   Resets the insulin (consciousness/emotions) in the brain.
9. Daydream - let thoughts take over and run themselves, instead of directing them.
   Neural and glucose reset. Foster creativity by linking thoughts.
10. Push down authority.  Let others decide/do.
