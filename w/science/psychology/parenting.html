Distict America parenting: "Wow", "good job" is nowhere in the world.
Can be gentle with a smile or nod.

Inuit kids are imune to tantrums.
On a tantrum, hold on, and be very calm - eliminate any conflict.
Calm voice relaxes kids.

We think of kids "pushing buttons, or testing boundaries"
But they are too young to do that.
Children are irrational and illogical, have not matured.
If you argue back you are bing a kid.
Reduce anger at kids, they love you and want to help.

We do not know what to do with kids.
Being responsible for entertaining, or keeping them busy is nowhere in the world.
In spaces designed for kids, kids don't learn to behave as adult.
Kids want to help us, child-centered activities counter this.
Do what you usually do and adjust to include kids.
Let kids tag along and do what they want.

Alloparenting (caretakers other than mom/dad) more in non-western cultures.
Kids are designed to be raised by a group of people - not just 2.
Teachers, camp leaders, older kids are alloparents.
12 year old can prepare meals for younger kids.

"Auntie-uncle network" alternate picking up kids from school.
Not natural for parent to be with kid every moment.
