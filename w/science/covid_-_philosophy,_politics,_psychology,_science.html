<a name="freedom"></a>From: <a href="https://www.cjr.org/analysis/covid-19-coronavirus-uncertainty.php">The pandemic and the information network</a>
Article from the Columbia Journalism Review, starts with:
There are two viruses: virus as it really exists and virus as we understand it.

An important idea in the article is an Edison (~1910) quote:
<b>There Is No Expedient to which a Man Will Not Resort to Avoid the Real Labor of Thinking</b>
This is from Joshua Reynolds (English painter ~1760):  In the practice of art, as
well as in morals, it is necessary  to keep a watchful and jealous eye over ourselves;
idleness, assuming the specious disguise of industry, will lull to sleep all suspicion
of our want of an active exertion of strength. A provision of endless apparatus,
a bustle of infinite inquiry and research, or even the mere mechanical labor of copying,
may be employed, to evade and shuffle off real labor ‚Äî the real labor of thinking.

Kind of related to:
"People demand freedom of speech for compensation of freedom of thought which
they rarely use."  S√∏ren Kierkegaard, ~1840 Danish philosopher/theologian
                                                                                <a href="#top">got to top</a>

<a name="virus"></a>From: <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2020/04/pandemic-confusing-uncertainty/610819/">Why the Coronavirus Is So Confusing</a>
by Ed Yong Zoologist/science journalist. 5/7/2020
1. <b><i>Virus</i></b> SARS-CoV-2, one out of 7. Others: MERS, SARS1 + 4 causing cold.
   500 corona viruses identified in bats - there is probably 10's of thousands.
   People close to bats have antibodies to SARS-like viruses.
   Around 1 to 7 million are exposed to bat viruses.
   SARS-CoV-2 is changing steady and predictably - no chance of bad mutations.
2. <b>COVID-19</b> No symptoms to severe. Variable case fatality rate: 0.1 to 15%.
   It depends on spread of age, pre-existing conditions, hospital access,
     and hospital quality.
   Damages: lungs, airways, hearts, blood vessels, kidney's
     guts and nerves(?).
   People want hydroxychloroquine without the proof.
3. <b>Research</b> 7,500 papers published since pandemic began.
   Symptom-less spreading took a while to be believed.  Viral levels peak as
   symptoms appear. Scientific understanding oscillates but converges.
   Publishing is rushed. Public access to non-reviewed research.
4. <b>Experts</b>  Lawyer, qualified because of his cross-examination skills(?), says
     ‚Äúthe current organized panic in the United States does not seem justified‚Äù.
   An economist knows hydroxychloroquine statistics better than an epidemiologist?
   Scientific caveats instead of absolutes are suspicious because society
     rewards projected confidence over humility.
   Science's similar flaw:
     "Nobel prize elevates  individuals for work that is usually done by teams,
      and perpetuates the myth of the lone genius."
   Idea that there are no experts is glib - experts are deep and narrow.
   Pandemic requires depth and breath: use antibody testing...
   Armchair epidemiologists do not have solution - may have misinformation.
5. <b>Messaging</b> In January 26 experts misjudged epidemic would be pandemic.
   Others warned that we should plan for the worst.  Alarmism is equated
   with misinformation - but this wasn't so.  The right people were not in right
   place to be heard.  WHO did not give the Taiwan/Hong Kong details...  CDC was
   silent and reversed position on masks: dangerous communication.
   People loose trust & misinformation spreads.
6. <b>Information</b> People share useful information, but COVID info is:
   1. persistently uncertain, 2 politicized, 3 governed by algorithms (social media).
   <b>"Amid the psychological loam of fear and uncertainty, conspiracy theories
     are germinating like weeds."</b>
   Politics: 1 deny responsibility, 2 scapegoat, 3 incite culture war,
     and 4 bend reality.
   Media's piecemeal coverage cannot cover pandemic:
     1. has no background knowledge, 2 amplifies the wobbliness of science,
     3. intensifies uncertainty, 4 drives people to misinformation.
7. <b>Numbers</b> 20% of tests are positive.  15 to 30% false negatives.
   Flu deaths are estimated from model; COVID is underestimated.
   Accuracy of tests create illusion of reinfection.
   Antibody test: 93.8% accurate with 4.4% false positives. Assume 50 in 1000 are
     truly infected.  50*0.938=47 true positives.  950*0.044=42 false positives.
     Positive test is a coin toss!  COVID case count is off by 10 to 100.
     See: <a href='./math/sensitivity_specificity_predictive_value.txt' onmouseenter="enterLink(event)" >sensitivity_specificity_predictive_value.txt</a>; Bayesian probability ...
   People underestimate the difficulty of measurements.  Predicting is even harder.
   Uncertainties do not refute consequences of an uncontrolled pandemic.
8. <b>Narrative</b> Unlike other disasters, virus is not visible creating a
     cognitive dissonance. Prevented losses from lock-down cannot be seen.
   Virus co-opts cells and exploits cognitive biases. Saving lives versus
     the economy is false.  Lionizing nurses and cashiers ignores risks they are
     asked to face.
   Blaming China or Trump disregards: 1 population explosion, 2 air
     travel, 3 bad health care, 4 just-in time economy, 5 fragile supply chains,
     6 health care linked to employment, 7 internet misinformation, 8 devaluation
     of experts, 9 marginalized elders, 10 racism in health care.
   <b>"It may be easier to believe that the coronavirus was deliberately unleashed
     than to accept the harsher truth that we built a world that was prone to it,
     but not ready for it."</b>
                                                                                <a href="#top">got to top</a>

1880's: link mosquitoes and malaria via bird experiments - not easy.
From a model control malaria by controlling mosquitoes;
  do not need to control every mosquito to control malaria;
  reduce enough so that reinfection, R, less than 1.
Model of swine flue agrees with school opening/closing.
Ice bucket challege: R=1.4 and serial interval defined in the game.
<b>Serial interval</b>: time between symptoms of case 1 and those of and infected case.
China reduces Covid's' from 7.8 days to 2.6  and transmission by 60%.
South Korea was 3.68 days.
Only 40 cases in China and 3 outside China indicates thousands in China.
                      R    serial interval

Online content: visibility/social-links/content-char./audience-suspect.
Like virus posted messages may mutate and spread faster.
Viruses have evolution million of chances to spread.
Jobs not mobs (imply economics over immigration) twitter-facebook-trump...
2012 Higgs boson gossip via 2 superspreading event.
80% of transmission via 20% of infection (virus & online)
Superspreading makes outbreaks less likely to spark initially.
<a href='./flight-network.jpg'>Flight network</a> loops facilitates contagion.
20% of covid infections are before symptoms.
Location is important - for example cholera from water pump
Remove the pump measure==introduce control handle (may be late)
1. Disassortative network (highly connected people connected to less connected people)
   spreading starts slower but reaches more widely (2008 banks, malware are like this)
2. Assortative - social network - popular people hang out with popular people
   - spreads to highly connected
                                                                                <a href="#top">got to top</a>

<a name="dissonance"></a>From: <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2020/07/role-cognitive-dissonance-pandemic/614074/">Cognitive Dissonance</a> (anxiety from simultaneously having contradictory beliefs):
1. Very difficult to change one's minds. When the facts clash with preexisting
     convictions, one prefers to jeopardize their health than admit being wrong.
2. <b>Cognitive dissonance</b> (1950's): discomfort people feel when two conditions,
     or a cognition and a behavior, contradict each other; Smoking can kill vs I smoke.
   Dissonance very painful when it threatens our belief that we are smart, kind....
3. Make a difficult decision: COVID-19 is serious; no, It is a hoax.  And justify choice.
   Life-and-death decision is political rather than medical.
4. Experiment: People gone through an unpleasant process to be admitted to a discussion
     group, liked the group better than those allowed to join with no effort.
   Dissonance: I‚Äôm smart, so how did I end up in this stupid group?
   Reduce it by focusing on whatever is good or interesting about the group.
5. Justify dissonance: masks are harmful, masks kill, freedom vs communism,
     "more freedom than government is the answer", first amendment...
6. Challenge: 1 find to live with uncertainty, 2 make informed decisions,
     3 modify decisions when the scientific evidence dictates
7. Self reflect to change mind.
8. Resolution example; friend has offensive belief - resolve the dissonance by:
     keep friend and know belief is offensive - do not do "either or".
9. Change someone's mind: reference someone that thinks the same.
                                                                                <a href="#top">got to top</a>

<a name="government"></a><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plato%27s_five_regimes">Plato's regimes (systems of government)</a>:
1 Aristocracy (aristo: best/noblest, cracy:power")
     philosophers/kings grounded on wisdom and reason - do not own property.
2 Timocracy (timi: honor)
     powerful/military rulers - do not own property.  Strong/just laws.
3 Oligarchy (oligos: few)
     rich rulers  and possibly incompetent - own property.
4 Democracy (demos: common people)
     ruler is consumed by non-instinct/non-survival desires - poor people are free
       to break law; vulnerable to demagoguery; reduction of questions to us vs them;
     see Modes of persuasion below.
5 Tyranny (tyrannos: master, illegitimate ruler)  (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lydia">Lydian</a>)
     lawless cruel ruler - reaction to no one having any discipline.

3 <i>Logos</i> - appeal to logic or simulation of it.
  Maybe factual or misleading and inaccurate.
  If no time for complex facts; may have partial or whole lies.
4 <i>Pathos</i> - appeal to audience's emotions.
  Most effective when speaker/audience share emotion.
  Common appeals: fear, imagination, hope

<a name="vaccine"></a>From: <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2021/01/science-covid-19-manhattan-project/617262/">How Science Beat the Virus</a>
by Ed Yong Zoologist/science journalist. 12/14/2020
1. 74,000 COVID papers - nore than twice the other papers
   SARS‚ÄëCoV‚Äë2: 1. most characterized pathogen 2. helpful to other virus research
   But: Flawed research made the pandemic more confusing,
        Millions spent on sloppy/pointless trials.
        People published misleading work on topics in which they had no expertise.
        Racial and gender inequalities in the scientific field widened.
   COVID brought out science as:
        (1) self-correcting march for knowledge to serve humanity,
        (2) self-interested pursuit of greater prestige at the cost of truth
2. Preprints became mainstay to publish.
   Chinese decoded the virus genome in 10 days after first case.
   By November ~ 200K virus genomes were sequenced.
3. 54 vaccines tested for efficacy and 12 in phase 3;
   <i>mRNA</i> lipid nanoparticles with pieces of the virus genome
   Phase 1 started 66 days after publication of virus genome.
   Failure to contain virus speeded vaccine development;
   Korea could not do phase 3 trials.
   Dexamethasone reduces mortality by 12%.
   Medical care improved through experience, had bigger effect.
   Monoclonal-antibodies, bamlanivimab, prevents illness.
   277 hydroxychloroquine useless trials because of hype.
   100,000 people in convalescent plasma tests did not give any results.
   Redefine clinical research - ACTIV in USA Recovery (timeforrecovery.org) in UK.
   (Article dopes tot mention that although there were no previous mRNA vaccines,
    technology for mRNA vaccine was developed long before covid.)
4. Years after 2003, after SARS-1, myalgic encephalomyelitis (ME; fatigue/brain fog).
   ME (with other virus infections) dismissed as imaginary/psychiatric.
   Like the vaccine, large infections facilitates ME (Long-covid) research.
   Same for myocarditis (heart inflammation); Flu and 20 other viruses may cause it.
   Respiratory viruses are most likely to cause pandemics;
   mostly cause mild cold-like illnesses; neglected - "just a cold";
   coronaviruses (229E, NL63, OC43, HKU1), SARS1+2, MERS, syncytial, parainfluenza,
   rhinoviruses, adenoviruses, bocaviruses.
   Since 1930s "bad air" replaced by "droplets" - but aerosol (masks, ventilation)
     is more important.  COVID vaccine platform will be reused.
5. Science is mostly a zero-sum game; got long term studies with data holes,
     and lost billion dollars on clinical trials.
   NIH got $3.6 billion, Gates gave $350 million.
   ‚ÄúWhenever there‚Äôs a big pot of money, there‚Äôs a feeding frenzy,‚Äù
   2020 had 1.5 million covid and 1.5 tuberculosis deaths, yet tuberculosis was paused.
   But Ebola and Zika defunding did not do any damage.
   <i>Epistemic transpassing</i>: data analysis/publishing from home by non-qualified
     experts made things worse.  Exception to this:
     Leeuenkoek (draper) - microbes.  Wegener (meteorologist) - continental drift.
   <i>Ecological fallacy</i> (faulty conclusion for using data large regions):
     Country with higher cigarette-usage has longer life expectancies;
       not because of smoking but because smoking is popular in wealthy nations.
     People clueless with tuberculosis mistakenly linked the BCG vaccine and COVID‚Äë19.
   Reinvent the wheel: use lasers to show that speaking releases aerosols;
     done this in 1946 without lasers!
   False narrative shaped (UN) discussion for humidity/transmission.
   Only 16% of PhDs are tenure track - competition to publish (or noise pressure) is ferocious:
   Speed, short-termism, and hype at the expense of rigor - accelerated with covid.
   Rushed/dubious work overwhelmed and slowed researchers; the money frenzy.
   White men grabbed more COVID opportunities than non-white-males;
     Matthew effect: small successes snowball into greater advantages, irrespective of merit.
       cumulative advantage; "the rich get richer and the poor get poorer";
       Gospel: "For to him who has will more be given; and from him who has not,
         even what he has will be taken away"
       Originally on the inequality how scientists were recognized;
         credit unjustly given to more famous scientists
6. Poverty causes disease; Virchow, Prussian doctor, 170 years ago:
     ‚ÄúMedicine is a social science.. politics is large scale medicine‚Äù.
   Social aspect forgotten after the germ theory's success in late 1800s.
     After 1980's epidemiologists added poverty, privilege, and living conditions to health.
   Social epidemiologists: study ‚Äúcritical periods that can affect a persons life trajectory‚Äù.
   NIH got billion in COVID funds, but National Institute of Child Health... got nothing.
   Science journal ran political editorials to hold the president accountable.
   Medicine is both biological and social.
COVID‚Äë19 exposed warped incentives, wasteful practices, overconfidence,
inequality, and biomedical bias.
                                                                              <a href="#top">got to top</a>

<a name="after"></a>From: <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2020/12/pandemic-year-two/617528/">Where Year Two of the Pandemic Will Take Us</a>
by Ed Yong Zoologist/science journalist. 12/29/2020
from epidemiologists, physicians, immunologists, sociologists, and historians
1. 1918 flu killed 100 million but not covered/forgotten because of WWI and the
   Great Depression.  Politics determines what we remember or forget.
   In December 2,379 daily average deaths - 2,403/2,977 in Pearl harbor /  9/11
   Improvement depends on: vaccination, using masks, avoid indoor crowds, countering
     misinformation and (?) countering virus mutations.
   Will get surge of long covid and mental health cases.
   Social gap will get wider, grief will turn to trauma.
   Will use vaccine without soul searching.
2. Vaccine Endgame:
     Vaccine is delicate, there is no vaccine registry.
     No federal coordination.
     27% people do not want the vaccine
     One problem is noticed more that many successes.
     Misinformation creates lasting memory, correction does not change it.
     Blacks remember the Tuskegee syphilis experiment.
2. The New Patchwork:
     Vaccines deployed unevenly giving a patchwork of immunity
     Not sure for 70% vaccinations for herd immunity.
     Clusters of unvaccinated people will have outbreaks
     Faster recovery if rely more of non-vaccine measures,
       including funding of closed businesses.
3. The virus's next move
     Like polio, measles, tuberculosis, cervical cancer, vaccine will not eliminate it.
     Future depends on immunity's response to vaccine and virus's response to vaccine.
     Vaccine immunity longer than infection immunity (6 moproverbnths).
     Virus mutates 10% the speed of flu mutations.
     Measles has high mutation rate but cannot escape vaccine from 1960's;
       mutations weaken the measles virus - evolution does not always work.
     Most vaccines target the spike protein (easy). Michael Mina:
     ‚ÄúWe‚Äôve never bottlenecked a virus like this... virus is very abundant"
     Milder coronaviruses evade immune system within 10 years.
     We can stay ahead of virus - mRNA vaccines are customizable.
4. The lasting scars
     Health care workers are tired and angry - did not have to be like this.
     2,900 died others quit. Antimmigaration exacerbates the worker shortage.
     Aging population will increase health care demand.
     Chronic diseases, depression, anxiety, substance abuse, and eating disorders.
     25% to 50% of infected people have symptoms for more than a month.
     Many long haulers (brain fog, memory issues, pain) close to a year.  Also
       autonomous nervous system (POTS-postural orthostatic tachycardia syn.)
     93% long haulers not recovered since June - 72% had work problems.
4. The widened gaps
     After WW2 instead better child care, education, maternity leaves, women
     encouraged to stay home: now women do work that a welfare state could be doing.
     Covid closed schools and women lost jobs.
     Gap of white/black expectancy widened from 3.6  years to 5.
     "Acceptable to blacks not to not do well, locked up, die"
5. The lessons learned
     Medical privacy hid effects of covid.
     Political fissure with disagreement of what is reality.
     Conspiracy theories are mainstream - cannot agree on shared excerpt of
       events. "How a country learn from its mistakes if it cannot even agree on
       whether it made any"
     In 2019 US was first in Global Health Security Index in 195 countries.
     Index correlates to hubris and unpreparedness than to covid deaths.
     Idea that West is more advanced than East and Africa is not true.
     West focused on capacity and neglected capability.
     East/Africa had experience and the cultural memory.
     Vietnam was impeccable, relentless with large public support.
     Rwanda, 117 on the index, mandated masks from the beginning.
     After 9/11 preparedness was national security, fighting outbreaks was for
     other countries - at the expense of public health investments.
     "Cannot prevent a pandemic by preparing for a war"
     "Think of epidemics as a million rivers that must all flow through the same lake.
      The U.S. has been trying to dam the rivers. It has to focus on the lake."
     ‚ÄúEpidemics are always social phenomena with historical roots,‚Äù
     US has history of plastering social problems with technological fixes - think
     vaccines win the day and forget the cost of idleness.
Historian D. Lowenthal: ‚ÄúThe art of forgetting is a high and delicate enterprise ‚Ä¶
It can be a process of social catharsis and healing or one that sanitizes and
eschews the past.‚Äù  "Remember the:
   people who sacrificed to keep stores open and hospitals afloat,
   president who lied to them throughout 2020 and consigned them to disaster,
   families still grieving,
   long-haulers still suffering,
   weaknesses of the old normal,
Fail to understand the and the costs of reaching the new one".
                                                                                 <a href="#top">got to top</a>

<a name="CRM"></a>From: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crew_resource_management">Communication: Crew Resource Management (CRM)</a> Wikipedia
1970s: 70% of airline accidents caused by human error.
CRM began after plane ran out fuel and crashed while crew debugged landing gear
    used in dangerous time-critical decision; shipping, firefighting and operating rooms.

CRM:
1.Cognitive skills;
  gain and maintain situational awareness,
  solve problems,
  make decisions
2.Interpersonal skills;
  communication: attention getter, state concern/problem/solution, get agreement (buy-in)

Sender errors
  No frame of reference - misunderstanding
  Omission of information - ambiguity.
  Inserting bias - personal opinion instead facts; no trusproverbt, mislead
  Ignoring body language - unintended message with body language and tone, or lack of
  Being unwilling to repeat information - distract receiver missed important info
  Disrespectful communication - cannot think logically after hostile presentation
Receiver errors
  Listening with prejudice - mind is made up before the sender speaks
  Poor preparation - Listening must be an active and conscious process.
  Thinking ahead of the sender - put words in the sender's mouth; sender says "Hear me out!"
  Ignoring nonverbal cues - Fail to understand the full intended effect of the message.
  Failure to ask for clarification - instead of guessing ask for clarification
  Disrespectful communication - Reply with a knee-jerk insult
Leadership
  Responsible for crew safety
  Foster respectful communication
  Establish goals
  Include crew input
Mentoring
  leader is responsible for mentoring;
  for high level of competence, and to build trust
Conflict resolution
  Effective listening,
  remaining emotionally uninvolved,
  focus on understanding the cause of a situation
Fellowship
  Respecting authority
  Being safe
  Keeping one's ego in check
  Balancing assertiveness and respect
  Demanding clear assignments
  Reporting on status of work honestly, including any problems

Hazardous attitudes
  Anti-authority: "Don‚Äôt tell me." - "Follow the rules. They are there for a reason".
                   Rules are "written in blood"; after a major incident.
  Impulsivity: "Do it quickly." - "Not so fast. Think first."
               "Slow is smooth and smooth is fast".
  Invulnerability: "It won't happen to me." - "It could happen to me."
  Machismo: "I can do it." - "Taking chances is foolish."
  Resignation: "What's the use?" - "I'm not helpless. I can make a difference."
  Pressing: "Let's hurry up so we can go home" - "It's worth doing right the first time."
             related to impulsivity, but driven by a desire to return to something SOPother than the task,
             the proverbial "roast in the oven".
  Airshow syndrome: "I'm going to look amazing!" -
                    "Let's get the job done right".

Indicators of loss of situational awareness
    Ambiguity - Incomplete info, multiple interpretations.
    Distraction - Attention away from task.
    Fixation - Focusing on detail and exclude the big picture.
    Overload - Busy/overwhelmed to keep track of what's happening.
    Complacency - Comfort blinds one to approaching danger.
    Improper Procedure - Operating outside of standard procedure without justification.
    Unresolved Discrepancy The GPS says Boston, but I don't see a city!".
    Nobody Flying the Plane - "self explanatory", no one in charge of operations.

Error management; cannot always prevent errors, multiple "Barriers" can stop an error from becoming a disaster
    Acknowledge that we are error prone - for anyone, at any time
    Maximize barriers - Use redundancy, avoid under staffing, avoid one person's mistake becomes a disaster.
    Communicate risks - Speak up of danger, of anything preventing error detection, or what will make you make an error.
    Follow standard operating procedures - pilots ignoring them had 1.6 times the risk of making another mistake.
    Is action SENSIBLE? - Think logically, not emotionally.
                          Question loss/gain before acting.
