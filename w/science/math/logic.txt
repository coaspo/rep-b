Symbolic (deductive) Logic: A First Course  by Gary Hardegree  1999
http://courses.umass.edu/phil110-gmh/MAIN/IHome-5.htm

1. Logic: non-empirical science (like math) of correct/incorrect reasoning
     --> to distinguish correct from incorrect reasoning

2. Infer (to reason): premises (data/info/facts) --> conclusion
   Argument = {statements [premise(s)+'therefore'/'thus'.. +conclusion]}
     Statement: a true/false declaration
        Premise(s) intended to support conclusion
3. Inductive logic: probable though fallible conclusion from premises;
     Smoke --> (likely but fallible) fire
     True premises -->  likely true conclusion
     Subject of probability/statistics;
       No consensus of correct inductive reasoning
     Science: deductive & inductive
   Deductive logic: truth of premises necessitates truth of conclusion
     deductive correct --> inductive correct  but not the other way
     inductive  incorrect --> deductive incorrect
4. Statement = set of words/sounds/symbols in a given language
     topic of logic
     noun + predicate phrases
   Propositions = assertion of judgment/opinion - independent of language
     (meaning lurking behind statement;
      abstract; nobody knows exactly what they are)
   Statement<-->Proposition : noun:object  (water[5 letters]:water[molecules])
     Statement "Water is wet" is both
       statement on wetness & proposition that it is wet
   Statement "I am hungry", a proposition depends on context - who says it.

5. Syllogistic (together discourse)logic:
     all, some, no, not, is/are
   Sentential (sentence)logic:
     previous words + and, or, if..then, only if
   Predicate logic (first-order logic, or first-order predicate calculus):
     previous words + quantified variables
     used in math, philosophy, linguistics, computer science
   Logic form: precise semantic version of statement
    form/statement: logic terms/descriptive terms

6.  Argument:
      FACTUAL - premises are true
      VALID - good FORM - conclusion based on premise(s)
         goal of logic: understand "follows from"; determine valid/invalid
         ---> true premises give true conclusion
         but may have F/T F/F
      SOUND - factual & valid (form) --> always true conclusion

7. (Categorical) Syllogism: argument of syllogistic logic;
     2 premises + conclusion (all are descriptive terms of classes)
     concrete sentence --> sentence form:
       all dogs are mammals --> all X are Y
    Valid argument:
      all X are Y
      some Y are Z
      / some X are Z

8. Demonstrate invalidity via Counterexample
     (can prove invalidity, validity of form, but not validity of specific instance)
     uniform substitution instance: distinct letters replaced bu distinct descriptive terms
     intuitive definitions of validity:
        valid argument: if premises were true conclusion would necessarily true
   FUNDAMENTAL PRINCIPLE OF LOGIC:
     Validity is function of form;
     if argument is valid, every argument with same form is valid
       (true premises & conclusion do not make argument valid)
   TRIVIAL PRINCIPLE
     true premises + false conclusion --> invalid argument
   Counterexample:
     substitution instance with true premises & false conclusion
     Invalid argument:            Counter example:
     no cats are dogs             no men are women
     no dogs are apes             no women are fathers
     / no cats are apes           / no men are fathers   (false)
       Failure to find counter example does not make and argument valid.
   Only false counterargument (all T premises/F conclusion)
      ---> invalid argument.
     For others; all T/T, not all T/T, not all T/F need more info.
      (use Venn diagrams?)

9. Syllogism: valid syllogistic arguments:
     all X are Y     all X are Y       all X are Z     no X are Y
     all Y are Z     some X are Z      no Y are Z      some Y are Z
     / all X are     / some Y are Z    / no X are Y    / some Z are not X
   premises/conclusion of valid argument maybe: T/T  F/T  F/F; example of last:
     all carts are reptiles
     all reptiles are mammals
     /all cats are mammals
