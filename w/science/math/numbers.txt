Zero:         628 AD India
Infinity:     India 400 BC / Aristotle
              1D, 2D, area, everywhere, perpetually
Prime:        Eratosthenes 240 BC
Negatives:    100 BC China, 200 AD Greece
              up to 1700 ignored as meaningless
Rational:     hexadecimal fraction, Babylonias\n
Irrational:   sqrt(2); Pythagoras
Transadental: e/π 1844 AD (not root of finite polynomial)
Complex:      Heron 50 AD, Descartes --> sqrt(-1) = i (immaginary)
              cos(θ) + i sin(θ) = e ^(iθ)

1. Natural:  0,1,2,3
2. Integer:  ...-2,-2,0,1,2...
      even/odd/prime
        primes - integers >1 = product of primes
      perfect: 6 28  496  8,128  33,550,336  8,589,869,056 137,438,691,328
        num = sum of positive divisors (6=1+2+3)
      fibonacci: 0 1 1 2 3 5 8 13 21 34 55 89 144; fn
        f0 = 0, f1 = 1; fn = fn-1 + fn-2 ≈ 1.6118 * fn-1  (1.6.. golden ratio)
3. Rational: a/b;  a,b integres, b!=0
4. Real: covergenat sequence of rationals
     points on the number line
     almost all reals are irrational; e/π/sqrt(2)...
     algebraically not closed
5. Complex:  a+bi;  a,b real, i=sqrt(-1)
     algebraically closed; every polynomila has root
     not ordered; cannot compare 1 & i
     constructible: constucted with ruler & compass
     computable: algorith exists to compute them (Turing machine)
6. Hyper complex:
     coefficients (a0,a1,.. an) for basis {1,i1,.. in}; ik in {-1,0,1}
     Quaternion a + bi + cj + dk;  i^2 = j^2 = k^2 = ijk = -1
       4D real number associative normed division algebra
       Real/complex/quaternions: 1/2/4 dimensions
