  for example example news.google.com
    1. Windows edit:
         C:\Windows\System32\drivers\etc\hosts

Spoof MAC address
  1. Linux: Install (select yes):
      sudo apt-get install macchanger
    Find interface:
      ip addr
    (should see for example: 2: enp2s0)
    Change MAC after resume from sleep:
      make file writable:
        sudo chmod o+w /lib/systemd/system-sleep/hdparm
      add command:
        sudo macchanger -r enp2s0
      Verify with same command, should see similar to:
        Current MAC:   06:b7:49:3d:f2:81 (unknown)
        Permanent MAC: XX:XX:XX:XX:XX:XX (unknown)
        New MAC:       7e:20:b7:08:76:7d (unknown)
  2. Windows : run:
      devmgmt.msc
    Select: >Network adapters
            >Realtek PCIe GBE Family Controller
            >Rt-click >Properties
            >Network Address
    For value add:
      AABBCCDDEEFF
    Verify change; run:
      ipconfig /all
    should have:
      Ethernet adapter Ethernet:
      Physical Address. . . . : AA-BB-CC-DD-EE-FF

Block adult websites
  Connect to router; for example, for comcast browse:
    http:/10.0.0.1
  for userId/password use admin/password
  In Parental-control, Manage-sites add for example:
    https://www.bad.com
  But there are too many web sites to add!
  Alternative, change DNS server, see:
    https://www.opendns.com
