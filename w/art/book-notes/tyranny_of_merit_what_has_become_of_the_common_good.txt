  Harvard political philosopher, born 1953

  PROLOGUE________________________________________________________________________
  ________________________________________________________________________________
  US not prepared for pandemic: 1.Outsourcing  2. Economic/cultural/political;
  divisions because of rising inequality and cultural resentment.
  Outsourcing eliminated well-paying jobs and social esteem.
  Winners of globalization practice social distancing from losers;
  hubris and resentment propelled populists.
  Understand how, in four decades, social bonds and respect unraveled.

  INTRODUCTION: GETTING IN________________________________________________________
  ________________________________________________________________________________
  College admission scam: paying SAT proctors, bribing coaches, faking credentials.
  At fault: 'liberal elites' via "side door", wealthy with gifts via "back door".
  Prosecution for bribes.. not for the use of "side door".
  "Front door" is rigged - Yale students from top 1% than from bottom 60%.

  Political debate is how to achieve meritocracy; focus on cheating instead of the
  cause: "elite university obsession" is because of inequality.
  Inequality is wages with and without a degree.

  People were buying admission and the luster of merit.
  Fair meritocracy and strenuous effort makes us think that we made it on our own.
  If we fail then we can only blame ourselves.

  More self reliance, less gratitude and humility.

  How has meritocracy eroded dignity of work leaving people feel that elites look
  down on them?
  Do globalization winners deserve their success?

  Elite anger destabilized democracy. Should we still live by merit?
  or seek common good beyond merit?

  1. WINNERS AND LOSERS___________________________________________________________
  ________________________________________________________________________________
  Trump and Brexit was after decades old rising inequality.
  Politician must address economic AND cultural grievances.

  Populist discontent diagnosis:
    1. racial/ethnic/gender diversity -> cultural loss -> nativism/racism/misogyny
    2. globalization, technology -> economic loss -> anti-immigrants, anti-elites
    Loss is result of how elites and politicians governed.
    Elites are alarmed, do know that they failed.

  Technology and globalization (cause of failure)
    1. Technocratic politics: achieve public good via markets
       Open/closed trade instead of right/left -> open/close-minded; global/tribal
    2. Public questions for experts only; beyond ability of citizens
    Reagan/Thatcher: government the problem, market the solution.
    Clinton promoted global trade and financial deregulation.
    Obama campaigned on morals but bailed banks and did not help home owners.
    fueled the right/left (Tea party/Occupy),
    Populism against elites - mostly center-left parties.

  Opportunity rhetoric
    "you can make it if you try" no longer true; does not inspire.
    Inequality -> lower mobility.
    Health/education access -> higher mobility.

  Meritocratic ethic
    Ethic: we do not deserve to be rewarded or held back based on factors beyond our
    control. Is (not) having talent on our control? Morality: OK to reward talented
    less working than less-talented hard word working?
    Potent politics: merit creates conceit winners and humiliation and resentment in
    loosers.
    Perfect meritocracy: no sense of gift, grace, sharing of common fate; a tyranny or
    unjust rule.

  Humiliation politics
    Protest against humiliation: 1, resent winners 2. self-doubt
    Obama Clinton spoke of opportunity, Trump of winners/loosers.
    Brexit/Trump voters were the most with no college degree.
    Clinton's hubris: "I won places that are optimistic...."
    Trump on Paris agreement; "We don't want other countries laughing at us'"

  Technocratic merit & moral judgment
    Confucius, Plato: meritorious & moral should govern.
    American founders hoped that knowledgeable/virtuous govern.
    Feared direct democracy/demagoguery.
    No morality in technocratic meritocracy - just GDP.
    Economists/market do not answer rising inequality, dignity of work,....
    Meritocratic elites from 1940 to 1980, won war, improved civil rights...
    After 1990, inequalities, deregulation, financial crisis, gerrymandering..
    Technocratic merit (elevate professionals and reduce others) -> angry politics

  The populist uprising
    1958 "Rise of meritocracy"; level field for the poor (good) AND
    create hubris/humiliation and entitled/deserve-blame for winners/loosers (bad).
    Economy of: producers -> money managers.
    Experts technocrats make moral/political decisions; dis-empowered citizens.
    Need public discourse on meritocracy's effect on common life.


  2. "GREAT BECAUSE GOOD"; MORAL HISTORY OF MERIT_________________________________
  ________________________________________________________________________________
  Hire plumber dentist based on merit - efficient and fair.
  How merit became toxic?

  Why merit matters
    Affirms freedom - masters of our destiny; get what earned/deserve.
    Merit -> mastery/self-making/responsibility
    Responsible for morality AND fate/fortune/divine help(?)
    Is merit earned or a gift?

  Cosmic meritocracy
    Fate reflects merit:
       theology (God); sin -> punishment, righteous -> bounty
         Genesis is about merit.
         Book of Job, God teaches humility;
         suffering is not about merit - about mystery.
       modern version (human will);  indolence -> poverty, wealth -> hard work

  Salvation and self-help
    Salvation via good work (self-help) - God has to reward; is not omnipotent
       ''     an unearned gift - God omnipotent but allows evil & suffering
    Problem: God just/omnipotent and evil exists.
    Solution: free will - man responsible for evil; British monk Pelagius.
    St Augustine: if self-help for salvation -> pride, not humility
                  only grace -> salvation
    Luther saw: rituals/good-works -> self-help (merit) -> salvation
           grace (anti-merit; helplessness)  -> salvation
    Problem: how can I be sure of grace?
    Solution (Calvin): God call people to a vocation -> work ethic -> salvation.
                       Work to glorify God, not for wealth.
                       Work is sign, not source, for salvation.
        Weber: work hard & consume little -> capitalism
               "For everyone God has prepared a calling, which he profess & labor"
        Work slid from sign of salvation to source (merit).
        Middle age monks, spiritual aristocracy, were closed in monastery.
        Calvin slammed the monastery behind.
        Hubris: the grace-elect saw sin from weakness.
        Work ethic: capitalism, self-help, meritocracy.

  Providential thinking: then and now
    Merit was for salvation, now about economic success.
    Work-ethic was tense dialectic of merit and grace. Self-making ethic won the
    gratitude & humility.

  2. "GREAT BECAUSE GOOD"; MORAL HISTORY OF MERIT_________________________________
  ________________________________________________________________________________

    Less faith in God, more self-made and less gratitude?
    No - 1. belief in self-made 2. belief in deserve success (moral).
    Weber: Fortunate not satisfied with fortune, need to believe: 1. they deserves it
    2. less fortunate deserve their due; THE TYRANNY OF MERIT
    Meritocracy is providentialism (Christian belief, God controls all events)
    without God.
    Jackson Lears: self-salvation -> Providence (protective care of God) approved inequality.
      American culture: uneven contest of ethics: 1. fortune 2. mastery.
      1. Eclclesiastes: "..riches not skillful...; time chance happen to them all"
      2. Covenant of grace -> works;  Catholic rituals -> Protestant moral strivings
         part of Providence (care provided by God)
      Self-help + providentialism = meritocracy rocket fuel
      Moral damage: "Culture of control.. secular version of providentialism;
      technocratic (economic) instead of religious" - see providence in inequality
      and world struggles (wars)
    Providentialism flavors: 1. hubristic 2. punitive
      1. 2008 Goldman Sachs CEO: big pay is result of "doing God's work"
      2. Hurricance Katrina: dretribution for Mardi Gras (sex perversion)
         Haitian earthquake killed 200K+: pack with devil/rebellion against France
         9/11: 40M abortions, pagans, feminists, gays, lesbians, ACLU; secular America.
         Japanes tsunami: we need it to wipe out egotism

  Health and wealth
    Prosperity gospel (E W Kenyon)): God rewards faith with wealth and health.
       "I am blessed (wealthy/healthy)"
          "blessed": gratitude or deserved
       "Jesus died that we may live and abundant life"
        Individual responsible for for his fate - heal via prayer
        Gratifying when going well, demoralizing or punitive when going bad.
    Undo Obamacare - politician: higher cost for sick; sickness is sign of sin.
        Whole foods founder editorial: 70% of healthcare is preventable diseases
          (thru diet & exercise); the sick can blame themselves;  good health found
          in church of Whole food aisles.

  Liberal providentialism
     Republican and democratic politicians: "America is great because it is good"
     (Quote claimed from Alexis Tocqueville's Democracy in America. it is from
      a 1941 religious book)
     manifest destiny to conquer and make the world safe and democratic.
     But moral countries are not wealthy, and wealthy/powerful are not just.

  The right side of history
    Liberal's problem: "America is great because it is good" (salvation->goodness),
    implies that people are wealth because they are virtuous.
    Solution: accept meritocracy; welfare state criticism, personal responsibility.
        Welfare eligibility tied to personal responsibility.
    Liberal providentialism: defend policies as "the right side of history";
    not in Cold war but in Iraq war, Arab spring, Libya, Syria...
    argue from history before it happens.

  The arc of moral universe
    Obama: "the arc of moral universe is long, but it bends toward justice";
    from King, from an abolitionist; a prophetic call against injustice
    -> providential faith for hope to powerless and hubris to powerful.
    Cold war victory -> free-market vindication -> neoliberalism -> globalization
    (right side of history) -> deregulation -> 2008 crisis.
    Liberal "right side of history": global capitalism AND health care, LGBT rights..
    Ray Charles 'America the beautiful': 'God (may?) shed his grace on thee.
    Oh yes hid did' - providential (Go controls all events) faith; merit drives
    out grace or recasts as something we deserve.

  4. THE RHETORIC OF RISING_______________________________________________________
  ________________________________________________________________________________
    We view success the same way puritans viewed salvation - we earn it.
    Meritocrat: I deserve success from my hard (stressful) work.

  Markets and merit
    Markets: 1. maximize welfare 2. people free to give value to good/services
    3. via equal opportunity, get what deserve (Reagan/Thatcher)
    Merit rhetorics 1. personal responsibility (reign in welfare)
                    2. rising (if work hard you will..)
    -> popular backlash against meritocracy

  Rhetoric of responsibility
    Reagan: "We will never abandon those who, though no fault of their own,
             must have our help"; Coolidge/Hoover: 'no fault of their'
    Clinton: Opportunity responsibility go hand in hand & 'no fault of their own'
    British/German repeated  Opportunity/responsibility.
    Welfare state tracks responsibility; with bad behavior you are on your own.

  As far as your talents will take you
    All politician used, was Obama's favorite; "no matter what you look like.."
    Equal opportunity -> talent -> hard work -> won success -> deserve rewards

  Getting what you deserve
    "you deserve" in google ngrams has quadrupled since 1980
    Motivational tapes with subliminal messages - "I deserve to succeed"
    "luck egalitarian" philosophers - help victims of bad luck - not drug addicts...
    Politicians: "Want Britain to be the wold's great meritocracy"
                 "People attracted to sports because it is a true meritocracy"
                 "Want people to feel that can get ahead if they work for it"

  Popular backlash
    Clinton's bad luck: rhetoric of rising became insulting; Trump never used it.
    Trump supporters resented elites, experts, and professional classes.
    For those on bottom, rising rhetoric was a taunt.
    Tyranny of merit: 1. with globalization & inequality, 'deserve what you get" is demoralizing
    2. requiring college degrees, demeans those without it
    3. insisting social/political problems solvable only by educated (conceited) experts
       disempowers non-expert citizens

  Can you make it if you try?
    Most Americans believe in self mastery - majority of non-Americans do not.
    "Going from rags to riches" is more likely in China than in America.
    American overestimate rising, European underestimate it.
    Plato's "noble lie" is ευγενής ψεῦδος, but actually is γενναῖον εῦδος (brave lie):
              God created different people so that there is a guardian class.
    American dream myth: If on bottom, you can make it if you try.  (social harmony)

  Seeing and believing
    See world via hope and fears; beliefs and convictions.
    Meritocratic hubris: via globalization, successful deserve success and non-successful
    can blame themselves.
    Merit from aspiration to fact; Obama: "..you can make it if you try ...
    I became president because of education...."
    Typical political rhetoric: hope -> fact -> hope ....
    If merit is fact/aspiration, those who fail can blame themselves/the system.


  5. CREDENTIALISM: THE LAST ACCEPTABLE PREJUDICE_________________________________
  ________________________________________________________________________________
    Trump insisting Obama make his grades public: "I heard he was a terrible student"
    and threatened colleges if they made his grades public.

  Weaponizing college credentials
    Trump's vocabulary was fourth grade.  Said that his uncle was MIT professor;
    he had smart genes.  He repeated that he was smart -> displayed the humiliation
    which meritocracy can inflict.
    Biden exaggerated his academic credentials - politicians feel that they have to.
    Supreme court nominee's reply to sexual misconduct: "I busted my tail in college"
    Globalization -> inequalities -> liberals wanted equality of opportunity

  Education as the answer to inequality
    All politicians made education the solution to inequality and stagnant wages.
    Bush: "for every problem, solution starts with education"
    Clinton: "what you can earn depends on what you can learn"
    Obama: "you are competing with billions.. need good education"
    Liberals: globalism, as a fact of nature, came to stay; question how to adapt
    -> solution: education for minorities, woman, gays to compete in global economy.
    Solution is moral judgment by successful people - they say more education ->
    inequality is a failure of people not the system.
    Liberals "ignored monopolies, financialization, management" to confront no one.
    Education fixation: 1. blame those without a degree (2 out of 3)
                        2. promote credentializm  and prejudice against non-educated.

  The best and the brightest
    Obama and Michelle "went through fair sorting went Ivy League and deserve status"
    2/3 of his cabinet were Ivy League, all but 3 had advanced degree -> not related
    to wisdom or instinct for common good; Wall-street friendly to 2008 crisis ->
    discredited Democratic party and paved way to Trump.
    Language of judgment and evaluation to persuade: 1. just/unjust 2. free/unfree
    3. progressive/reactionary 4. strong/weak 5. pen/closed NEW: 6. smart/dumb
    Smart phone... smart governing

  The smart thing to do
    Bush used "digital age smart": smart cars and smart schools
    "not just the right thing but smart thing";
    Hilary Clinton: "use smart power...smart people.. the smartest I know"
    Obama: moral arguments for race, but "smart/dumb" on foreign policy & economics
           bonus: "smart" is bipartisan

  Elites look down
    European and American surveys:
    disdain for poorly educated is more pronounced and accepted than other prejudices.
    Elites: 1. disparage 2. not enlightened or more tolerant 3. unembarrassed for prejudice
    Less educated internalize the elite view - they can only blame themselves.
    Relentless meritocracy -> acceptance of inequality.

  Government by degree
    95%+ of congress are college graduates; credentialed minority governs uncredentialed majority.
    In 1960 75% had college degrees.
    British labor at 1979/2017 had 41/71% WO college degrees.
    PhDs in German government may resign because of plagiarism...
    Governing: not rocket science - requires practical wisdom & civic virtue.
    Best and brightest should govern is meritocratic hubris.
    Washington, Lincoln, Truman did not have a degree.
    Roosevelt's cabinet did not have advanced degrees.
    In US and Europe: worker parties -> educated elite parties.
    Rising rhetoric -> education -> dignified work -> fuel prejudice of non-educated
    -> non-representative democracy -> political backlash

  Technocratic talk
    smart/dumb: technical; non-partisan - avoid political debate
    Obama, a technocrat: source of disagreement is lack of information
       "president has bully pulpit (wonderful church platform) for good information"
      Leadership: inform/convince, not moral persuasion - avoid partisan/ideological hassles
      People are decent but need professionals (with hubris) to sort info.
      Healthcare was about bending the cost curve, not decency.
      Market incentives for tech development, healthier nutrition,...
      Smart growth, regulation, entitlement, government,...(90 times)
    Technocratic defects: 1. empower/dis-empower elites/citizens
    2. eliminate discussion/politics

  Technocracy versus democracy
    Technocrats and partisans both fail debating.
    About Brexit: "People had enough of experts"
    Oxymoron: "I believe in science"; Clinton & Obama

    But opinions direct perceptions/facts

  Debating climate change
    Republican/democrats 57/27 with non-college, climate change exaggerated
                         74/15 with college, ....
    Similar for science courses instead of college - about politics not science.
    An informing technocrat glosses over morals/politics; how to:
    1. reduce fossil industry's influence 2. undo "throw away" consumer culture
    3. gain trust in government/experts
    Power/Morality/Authority/Trust.
    Face failures of 4o years or meritocracy & technocracy.

  5. SUCCESS ETHICS_______________________________________________________________
  ________________________________________________________________________________
  Meritocracy versus aristocracy
    Aristocracy/meritocracy: wealth inherited/earned+luck+support+teachers....
    Rich/poor prefer aristocracy/meritocracy for inheritance/opportunity
      ''        ''   meritocracy/aristocracy for self-pride/no self-blame

  Meritocracy's dark side
    1958 "The Rise of Meritocracy" by Michael Young (sociologist, Labor party):
      passing aristocracy protected rich from self-regard,
      and poor from self-blame.  Rich could see wit, wisdom in poor equal to own.
      Poor knowing aristocracy was rigged could challenge it.
      Knowing morality of rank prevents winners/losers to believe in deserving.
      People classified by ability makes inequality wider; upper class not weakened
      by self-doubt; good education because they are gifted.
      "Elites trained in science inherit the earth".
      Meritocrats are "tactless as to unnecessarily offend non-elites";
      Clinton: "Trumpists are deplorables (deserve condemnation)"
      "First time in human history inferior man has no buttress for his self regard"
      Hubris + resentment = backlash
      Predicted 2034 less educated will rise against elites.

  Meritocracy reconsidered
    People complain not about meritocracy but failure to live up to it;
    Professionals pass education to children; meritocracy is a myth is inheritance....
    But is ideal meritocracy flawed?
    1. is meritocracy just? - philosophers/public say no/yes
    2. does if give hubris/humiliation? - yes based on politics, what to do about it?

  Would a perfect meritocracy be just?
    True equal access (family prevents it): perfect mobility: American & all democracies dream.
    1. freedom 2. hope that we get what we deserve
    Justifies inequality; no injustice if some run slow or fast.
    Is inequality morally just?

  Do we deserve our talents?
    1. Talent is matter of luck; do we deserve winning the lottery?
    2. Society values and rewards talents
    Deserving talents is conceit.

  Does effort may us worthy?
    Success: mixture of talent & effort
    Talent is embarrassing, effort is vindication;
    Olympic stories about hardships instead of feats.
    Meritocracy: 1. ignore moral arbitrariness of talent
                 2. inflate  ''  significance of effort

  Meritocracy Alternative 1: Market Liberalism (free-market)
    Economist-philosopher Hayek (1974 Nobel for how changing prices communicate
      information; inspired Thatcher):
      No government intervention for inequality
      No progressive taxation
      Welfare state is unethical
      Only freedom compatible equality is legal system.
      Careers open to everyone
      Government equal education programs are coercive
      No merit (deserving, moral...) - market outcome based on supply/demand.
      Hedge fund managers make more than teachers not because they deserve it.
      Equal start via government coercion is anti-freedom

  Meritocracy Alternative 2: Welfare State Liberalism
    John Rawls, political philosopher, Theory of Justice 1971:
      Thought experiment "original position", veil of ignorance (Kant):
      select where you want to live if you did not know your social position.
      Pay/talent inequalities are morally arbitrary
      Difference principle: Winners run as fast  and share with losers;
      Natural talents are common asset.
      Effort depends on family and social circumstance
      Redistributive taxation
      Provides negative argument: earning not deserved
      No positive argument for: 1. winners being indebted 2. taxation
    Obama: "Your are not one your own - we-re on this together"
    No convincing argument for community/welfare liberalism

  Rejecting Merit
    Hayek: Problem identifying merit - distribution justice based on moral merit
           instead of economic value leads to coercion (no freedom)
    Rawls: Income not based on merit but coincidence of talent/demand

  Markets and merit
    Morally no difference of value and merit - winners/losers feel the same.
    Neoclassical economics: get what you deserve based on supply/demand.
    In perfect  competitive market, people morally deserve labor rewards.

  Market value versus moral 0value
    Frank Knight 1920's:
      Productive contribution is little on non ethical measure of desert.
         Desert in philosophy: being deserving of something, whether good or bad.
      Having marketable talents is like inheritance - no morality.
      Want-satisfaction cannot be value because tastes/values change.
      We dispute (non-disputable) tastes - most troubling: want the "right" of wants.
      Teacher versus methamphetamine maker - illegal or not regardless of money
      drug maker cannot be more valuable.
      Casino-mogul/surgeon: gambling-desire/health values
      In perfect competitive market people do not morally deserve rewards.
      Price is not ethical value or human significance.
      No morality in economics.
      Value of satisfying demand depends on the morality of the ends it serves.

  Deserving or entitled
    Source of hubris/resentment: entitlements bases on merit, virtue, or desert.
    Punishing thieves protects property and stigmatizes thieves;
    overtime stigmatizing gets blurred with non-merit.
    Education/money has honor/social esteem which is political.
    Aristotelian justice about public offices and honors not distribution of wealth.
    Now populist revolt is anger of non-educated against the educated elites.
    Insist on right over good makes esteem a matter of personal morality.
    Compensating the disadvantaged is patronizing them.
    "Racial/sexual injustice reduced ... left with the smart/dumb injustice"

  Chance and choice
    Liberal "luck egalitarian": lucky to give to unlucky; merit defines unlucky.
    "Poor law thinking": determine if luck or poor choices; an immoral way to find
    what citizens owe one another; Problems:
    1. No based on compassion; failure to buy insurance is a bad choice?
    2. "Helpless victim" label - people present/perceive themselves as victims.
    Moral/civic cost of victim-hood: 1. Support disparaging 2. deny freedom & respect
    Start with rejecting merit, end supporting merit with vengeance.
    Brut luck (hit by meteor) vs option luck (gambler) -> meritocracy
    Not so clear: fire vs fire insurance.
    Insurance for lack of talent paid by those that have talent.
    Choice and responsibility reduces free-market/egalitarian friction.

  Valorizing talent
    Egalitarians  try to fix smart/dumb inequality but valorizing the smart.
    Income inequality not due to genetic superiority of intelligence;
    due to talent/work-role preferences.
    Money success not related to smarts.
    Talent/money/smart all valorized(!)

  Meritocracy's rise
    Blair 1996: "we are committed to meritocracy"
    Michael Young: "Is is hard in society that makes so much of merit to be judged as
                    having none.. no underclass has been left morally naked as that...
                    Meritocrats believe that success comes from merit and thus deserve
                    whatever they can get ... inequality becomes more grievous without
                    a bleat from the party that sought equality."
                    (other to stop using "merit", he had no solution)
    For center right & left rhetoric of rising language of moral progress & political
    improvement: "Those who work hard and play by rules (in global economy) will be
    able to rise as their talents will take them."
    Populist backlash was a surprise because the insult was not seen.

  6. THE SORTING MACHINE__________________________________________________________
  ________________________________________________________________________________
    Merit -> wealth and esteem inequality -> resentment -> bad politics -> division
    Success defined in education and work.
    Colleges: sorting machines: 1. get mobility via merit 2. entrench privilege
              3. promote corrosive attitude for success
    Sorting machines not good for: 1. democracy 2. students 3. higher education

  Conant's meritocratic coup d-état (stoke/blow of state)
    Before 1950's Harvard/Yale/Princeton for rich male Protestants, no exams;
    parties, sports, not studying -> wall street, law firms, research hospitals,...
    Closing the frontier ended opportunity (no land expansion -> mind expansion)
    1940's Conant chemist, Harvard president & in Manhattan project:
      * scholarship from Midwest public schools
      * SAT, based on army WWI IQ exam; 'for sorting the American population'
      * remake society based on merit;
      * individual freedom based on mobility (heart of argument)
         men develop capacities regardless of economic status
      schools will "recapture opportunity that was in the frontier"
      "industrial society must: assess abilities, develop talents, guide ambitions"
      High schools goals: 1st sorting, 2nd civic education; -> recruit merit elites
    Jefferson: wealth/birth aristocracy -> talent/virtue aristocracy
       Select genius youths in poor; nature scattered genius everywhere
       Free education in William and Mary college - not adopted
       Instead of "free opportunity and mobility", said: "natural aristocracy  will
       prevail over artificial aristocracy of wealth/birth".
       "Twenty of the best geniuses will be ranked from the rubbish annually and
       be instructed at the public's expense"

  Intimations of the tyranny of merit (indirect subtle hint)
    Jefferson education: 1. Mobility legitimizes merit 2. Denigration of non-geniuses
    Conant's reply: 1. Goal in economic mobility from one generation to another
                    2. Sorting would not valorize/denigrate
    Actual results: 1. Less mobility - still have classes 2. more valorize/denigrate
    Conant opposed GI bill - country needs better students not more.

  Conant's meritocratic legacy
    Harvard did not fully implement meritocracy, but now:
      * education: open poor, women, all ethnicities, with financial aid
      * academic merit via high school grades & SATs
      * argument for affirmative action regarding merit
      * college president rhetoric: excellence & opportunity go hand in hand
      * students praised for: excellence, diversity, talent, & effort

  SAT scores track wealth
    SAT highly correlated to wealth, not scholastic aptitude or native intelligence
    For 200K income chances for SAT score >1400/1600 is 1/5, for 20K income 1/50
    SAT tutoring up 1,000/hour (?)
    College board insisted SAT not effected but tutoring, but added test to Khan academy
    higher/lower income make more/less use of this.
    Grades not SATs identify poor students likely to succeed in college.
    SATs are coachable via gimmicks & tricks

  Meritocracy entrenches (diverse) inequality
    Gender, racial/ethnic diversity improved - half students identify as colored.
    Professionals help their children -> more students from economic top 1% then bottom 20%
    Harvard/Stanford all free for students with family income  <65K
    Children of working class are as likely for Harvard/Yale/Princeton as in 1954

  Why elite colleges are not engines of mobility
    Average 2% of students rise from bottom to top - some colleges 10%
    more to consolidate privilege than mobility
    political rhetoric: more mobility more students
    "what you earn is what you learn": more insulting than inspiring
    For more mobility -> more thorough meritocracy (?)

  Making meritocracy more fair
    Harvard admits 1/20 applicants 1/6 legacy applicants
    Duke admits donor applicants
    Williams college 30% are athletic applicants
    (Wealthy) athletics: squash, lacrosse, sailing, fencing ... horse back riding
    Fix: 1. drop SATs 2. drop wealthy privileges 3. class-based affirmative action
         4. government pull tax exempt unless half students are from lower classes
         5. stop the sorting because:
              1. resentment of those sorted out
              2. injury of those sorted in
              3. sorting diverts educating

  Sorting and the allocation of social esteem
    Conant thought sorting will not create social esteem
    But superiority is part of earning and deserving
    1995 'Excellence' by John Gardner:
      1. "we have complex organizations .. need to search for talent"
         "great talent hunt" -> "rigorous sorting"
      2. talent demand worth the pain of education losers
      3. college - the only passport for meaningful life
      4. achievement is not human worth (?)
    Yale adopted need-blind admissions
    Before college was rubbing elbows with wealthiest now with smartest
    "Re-sorting of higher education" - colleges ranked by selectivity;
       gap of high and low selectivity colleges widened;
       student with high SAT seek high selectivity colleges.
       Majority of colleges accept those who apply.
       Yale in 1972 accepted 30%, now 5%
       University of Chicago 77% in 1993, 6% in 2019
       4% of students attend hyper-selective colleges that accept <20%
       Why high scoring students in few hyper-selective colleges:
         1. lower transportation 2. lower information cost - to compare SATs to others
         3. hyper-selective colleges are at the apex of meritocratic prestige
         4. employees believe the sorting that these colleges make

  Wounded winners
    Re-sorting of higher edu. : 1. more inequality/wealthy students 2. damaged winners
    Success to get in viewed as individual/earned effort (merit hubris), but it
    is forged in pain - the soul-destroying demands of striving.
    High school years: stress, anxiety, sleep deprived, test, sport, dance, music..
    In Connecticut suburb 18% get disability diagnosis; 6x national average.
    Meritocratic arms race is unfair for: 1. for poor 2. children entangled.
    From 1976 to 2012 parents spent 5x more time to help children
    From 1981 to 1997 6-8 year-old playtime dropped 25% and homework doubled.
    "helicopter parenting" correlates with inequality;
     more in US and South Korea less in Japan, Sweden
    Wealthy teens: depressed anxious angry
      "The Price of Privilege": mental epidemic in wealthy teens;
      half of students binge drink abuse drugs
      1 in 5 had thought of suicide; rate  increased 36% from 2000 to 2017
      Why: "one path to happiness- money- which comes from attending prestigious college"
      Hoop jumping habit instead of think/explore who they are, what they like...
    Hidden epidemic of perfectionism:
      fragile self-worth contingent on achievement
      vulnerable to teacher, parent, & self judgment
      "Irrational ideals of perfect self have become have become desirable/necessary
      in a world where performance, status and image define a person's usefulness and value"
      "At time when young are sorted, sifted, and ranked by schools, colleges and workplaces,
      neoliberal meritocracy places strong need to strive, perform, and achieve at the center"
      one's merit=self-worth
    Harvard admissions' gap year in "Time Out or Burn Out for the Next Generation"

  Still hoop-jumping
    Comping (competing for admission into student organizations)
    Harvard Crimson Key Society boasts 11.5 acceptance:
      "We do not want to put anyone in front of tourists"
      Less need for talent than need to re-enact the trauma and the rush:
      "You just through huge hoop to get to Harvard and want to jump through
       more to get the adrenaline going again"
    Colleges are training for competitive meritocracy; presidents/deans say
    "students learn more outside the classroom than in them" - networking
    Law school instructors were told not to tell students when grades will be posted
    because it causes too much anxiety.

  Hubris and humiliation
    Need education reform to repair: 1. psyche of privileged 2.polarized civic life
    Sorting machine problems (tyrannies):
      1. for winners: anxiety, perfectionism, hubris, low self esteem
      2. for losers: demoralizing/humiliating sense of failure
      common moral source: "we are responsible for our fate" -> no solidarity
      to contend with rising inequality
    Complicit to income inequality and self-esteem: market-driven globalization,
    technocratic politics, oligarchic institutions.

  A lottery of the qualified
    40K apply to 2K position in Harvard/Stanford; to reduce sorting 1. winnow out
    10K 2. set up a lottery for the remaining 30K.
    Treat merit as threshold not as maximum - best admission officers cannot truly maximize.
    Talent is complicated and less predictable; Brady as the 199th pick.
    Objections to lottery:
     1. academic quality - most likely not effected; do experiment admit half/half..
     2. diversity - give multiple tickets or admit qualified diverse then run lottery
     3. legacies & donor children - ideally eliminated or give 5-6 tickets for legacy
        and sell tickets for donors
     4. admission by lottery renders selectivity less meaningful and so erodes the
        prestige of the top colleges - good, or bad if "res-sorting" has truly
        improved teaching and learning
     This will benefit ~20% of students. For 80% in non-competitive or no college,
     the problem is work with little reward and social esteem.

  Dismantling the sorting machine
    No easy because elite colleges are private. But can still do it:
    1. Leverage government financial and research funds.
       (Republicans imposed tax to some wealthy colleges)
    2. Fund public colleges, vocational schools, & job training
       Many state universities are in name only - funding dropped from ~50% to ~10%
       Student debt ($1.5 trillion in 2020) has soared.
    In 2014 $162 billion to universities, 1.1 billion on vocational training
      France, Sweden../USA spend 1%/0.1% GDP in "active labor market policies"
      Low funding due to: 1. belief that supply and demand will fix it
                          2. emphasis to higher education
    Higher education emphasis: 1. neglects/ disrespects other education 2. hurts economy

  The hierarchy of esteem
    Learning plumbing should be respected to contribute to the common good (HOW?),
    not as consolation prize for low SATs or lack of money for Ivy league.
    Author: "Been teaching moral and political philosophy & believe that moral and civic
             education is important" - instead of this
            "value neutral science and specialized courses are more prominent"
    Technocratic emphasis -> failure of technocratic elites + poor public discourse
    Knights of Labor union demanded reading rooms in factories to read public affairs
    In 1800's: equality in independence and judgment - labor's contribution to general
               good was mind and muscle.
               Equality not for mobility but for intelligence and learning.
    Nurses & plumbers suited to art of democratic argument as much as management consultants.

  Chastening merit's hubris
    Merit's (responsible and deserving) antidote -> indebted & lucky in success.
    Believing that we cannot control success in this or next world is hard ->
    thus merit drives out grace (as puritans also saw) sooner or later.
    Merit wins but is ungenerous to losers and oppressive to winners -> tyrant.
    Admissions lottery chasten merit's hubris.
    In 1960's seating in some schools, based on grades, would change after a quiz...
    To push back on merit, a teacher asked students to create their own T/F quiz.

  7. RECOGNIZING WORK_____________________________________________________________
  ________________________________________________________________________________
    From 1945 to 1970's one without college degree could support a family.
    From 1979 to 2000's degree/non-degree pay change from 40% to 80%' ("the college premium")
      CEO pay 30x to 300x the average worker's.
      Productivity and GDP/capita increased 85% but non-degree real pay is less

  Ending the dignity of work
    Meritocracy -> 1. economic hardship 2. work dignity erosion
    Money we make reflects our social contribution is embedded
    Globalization -> Inequality -> Resentment
    Most people without diplomas voted for trump.
    1971/2016 93%/80% of working men employed - 68% with only a high school education.
    Most of 20% stopped looking for work.

  Deaths of despair
    "Despair deaths" (self-inflicted): suicide, drug overdose, alcoholic hepatitis
       Oxycontin dulled the pain (mostly construction workers)
       by 2014 more than from heart disease
       by 2016 more deaths per year than entire Vietnam war
                           per 2 weeks then Iraq/Afghanistan war of 18 years
       Not correlated with rising poverty
       2014-2017 life expectancy decreased
    Without a degree:
      1. 4x chances of dying than those with a degree
      2. less quality of life; level of pain, ill health, decline ability to work/socialize
      3. less family/community stability
    Michael Young vindicated: "No underclass has ever been left as morally naked"
    Gardner knew it: "those that saw the beauty of going ... as far as you can overlooked
                      the ones who can't...pain there is and MUST be"

  Sources of resentment
    Trump did best in "despair death" and lack of degree regions.
    Pundits/politicians were surprised because they were oblivious/complicit
    Elite & progressives belittle working class whites:
      1. "trailer trash" - lower class whites
      2. "flyover states" - when traveling from coast to coast
                            1. West Virginia, 2. Kansas, 3. Mississippi
      3. "plumber's butt" - when bending over
      4. "deplorable" - deserve condemnation
      5. "cling to religion and guns"
    "To write off white class anger as racism is comfort food and dangerous"
    White laborers got low wages and a public/psychological wage:
      white privilege: parks, good schools, public functions..
      After civil rights, psychological wage subsidy fell away - not knowing
      that somebody is worse off.
    Liberals disgusted by lower-class white racism, but do see that attributing
      "white privilege" to working-class whites is galling (annoying/humiliating);
      they ignore struggle for honor for work skills that lower-class whites have.
    Wisconsin rural people think:too much tax money goes to undeserving people:
      1. minorities on welfare 2. professionals producing ideas
    Sociologist Arlie Hochschild embedded in Louisiana, conservative workers (bottom 90%):
      economic deprivation, cultural dislocation
      need government help but distrust it
      problem: automation, off-shoring, multinationals, and for white men competition
               for jobs, recognition, & government jobs increased
      Believed that they waited in line and blacks, women, immigrants, refugees
      were cutting ahead of them. Resented line cutters and complicit politicians.
      Elites called them racists, rednecks, "white trash".
      "You are a stranger in your land... struggle to feel seen ... no fault of yours
      ... in hidden ways you are slipping backward."
    Need work dignity in political agenda - no easy...
    "The ways that a society honors/rewards work is how it defines the common good"
    Common Good; Pope: “sum total of social conditions which allow people, either
                        as groups or as individuals, to reach their fulfillment
                        more fully and more easily.”
                Economists: sum of everyone's interests and preferences
    "What contributes to common good and what do we owe each other as citizens?"

  Rewarding the dignity of work
    Conservatives: cut welfare, reduce food stamps to honor dignity of work
      Trump on 2017 tax: "dignity of work ...pride of paycheck"
    Liberals: raise minimum wage, health/child care, family leave.
      Working class whites fearing cultural displacement voted with "middle finger" -
      against their economic interests - more for fear of obsolescence.
      Robert Kennedy: "unemployment means having to be without use to one's fellow
                       citizens - to be the Invisible Man of Ralph Ellison"
      Talk of distributive instead on contributive justice
    Distributive justice balance maximizing GDP - from globalization distribute
    wealth to displaced workers via taxation.
    Since 1980's center-left in US and Europe: embrace globalization/prosperity to
       offset loss of local workers (losers). Problems:
       1. Never fully implemented - losers never retrained/compensated; due to
          oligarchic capture of democratic institutions
       2. Emphasis on GDP puts emphasis on consumption not production
          As consumers/producers we want cheap productions/satisfying work
          (balance this via politics)
    Globalization was for maximizing economic growth/consumers; no regard of the
    effect of outsourcing/immigration/financialization to producers (workers).
    Elites failed on the inequality and dignity of work.

  Work as recognition
    Purchasing power, safety net (medicare, food stamps..) do nothing for anger/self-esteem
    Civic conception: Common Good is elevating and improving preferences
                  not about summing preferences or maximizing consumer welfare.
    Role as producer more important than as consumer.
    Contribution value is moral/civic, not wages (demand/supply)
    Adam Smith: "consumption is the sole end of all production"
    John Keynes: " '' ... of all economic activity"
    Aristotle: ___"humans flourish through cultivation/exercise of abilities"___
    American republic tradition: agriculture, then artisans, then all labor
                                 cultivate virtues for self-rule.
    1900's republic tradition -> consumerism, economic growth
    Martin Luther King: "society come to respect sanitation workers if it is to
                         survive.... all labor has dignity"
    Pope 1981 : "through work man ...become 'more a human being' increase
                 common good with his compatriots"
    Catholic bishops ~1985: "people contribute to society in ways that respect
                             their freedom and dignity of their labor"
    Axel Honneth, philosopher: wealth distribution is about recognition/esteem
    Hegel: labor market is system of recognition, markets do not provide skills
           or recognition; trade associations could do that

  Contributive Justice
    Economic growth/consumerism appeals to pluralists societies with disagreements;
    spares contentious moral/controversial debates.
    Disagreements of meaning of: 1. life 2. human flourishing 3. preferences/desires
    Maximizing consumer welfare is neutral; agree to maximize the economic pie
    than to shrink it.
    Contributive Justice is not neutral on best way to live; contribute to common
      and earn the esteem of fellow citizens.
    Fundamental need is to be needed by those who we share life.
    Robert Kennedy: "Fellowship, community do not come from consuming together..
    come from dignified employment and good pay... I helped built this country"
    Progressives 'rising' rhetoric:  "go to college", "compete in global economy",
                      "what you earn is what you learn", "make it if you try"
                    -> flatter winners & insult losers

  Debating the dignity of work
    Uncomfortable question: Do market outcomes reflect the true social value of
    people contribution to common good?
    We confuse money we make with value we make; from meritocratic hope that
    we get what we are due; from Old Testament to "right side of history".
    Material success as as sign of moral desert is a temptation.
    Debate would not produce agreement but would:1. disrupt complacencies
    2. moralize public discourse 3. move beyond polarized politics

  The Hubris of "Open Agenda"
    Owen Cass, political advisor, 'The Once and Future Worker' 2019: On grievances
      tapped and failed to resolve: enable workers to find jobs that pay well to
      support  strong families and communities - matters more than economic growth.
      1. Wage subsidy (anti payroll tax) for low paying jobs.
        Denmark, Netherlands covered 75% to 90% of wages during pandemic.
        (US gave unemployment insurance; people lost jobs)
      2. Scale back environmental regulations in manufacturing/minig
      3. Restrict trade, outsourcing, and immigration
      Globalization is not right or left, but "open or closed";
      the college grads, winners, are "open" and critics are "closed" / bigots
      "It is hard to imagine a more condescending way of defending neoliberal
       globalization to those it leaves behind."
      The "open" propose for better education, more opportunity...
      "If the economy no longer works for average worker, it is he who needs to
       transform into something it likes better."
      "Open" is not sustainable where majority is left behind... question is not
       whether the "open" will lose but rather to what.


  Finance, Speculation, and the Common Good
    2008 finance crisis; debate 1. terms of taxpayer bailout 2. Wall Street reforms
    3. (mush less) how finance remade the economy and transformed "merit/success".
    Trade & immigration more attention than finance in populist backlash.
    Finance industry is large in advanced economies; % of GDP tripled since 1950's.
    In 2008 it had 30% of corporate profits.
    Less on real investments/productivity and more on profits via complex finances.
    Adair Turner: "little evidence that finance last 20-30 years has increased
      growth/stability...possible that it extracts rent (windfalls) from economy"
      (Windfall gain: an unexpected; from lottery, inheritance, or supply shortage.)
      translation: 1990's deregulation did more harm than good.
    Michael Lewis 'Flashboys': fiber link between Chicago and New York increased
    speed by few milliseconds for futures  - worth hundreds of millions (?)



The tyranny of merit what has become of the common good by Michael J. Sandel    🗓 2020
Harvard political philosopher, born 1953

PROLOGUE________________________________________________________________________
________________________________________________________________________________
US not prepared for pandemic: 1.Outsourcing  2. Economic/cultural/political;
divisions because of rising inequality and cultural resentment.
Outsourcing eliminated well-paying jobs and social esteem.
Winners of globalization practice social distancing from losers;
hubris and resentment propelled populists.
Understand how, in four decades, social bonds and respect unraveled.

INTRODUCTION: GETTING IN________________________________________________________
________________________________________________________________________________
College admission scam: paying SAT proctors, bribing coaches, faking credentials.
At fault: 'liberal elites' via "side door", wealthy with gifts via "back door".
Prosecution for bribes.. not for the use of "side door".
"Front door" is rigged - Yale students from top 1% than from bottom 60%.

Political debate is how to achieve meritocracy; focus on cheating instead of the
cause: "elite university obsession" is because of inequality.
Inequality is wages with and without a degree.

People were buying admission and the luster of merit.
Fair meritocracy and strenuous effort makes us think that we made it on our own.
If we fail then we can only blame ourselves.

More self reliance, less gratitude and humility.

How has meritocracy eroded dignity of work leaving people feel that elites look
down on them?
Do globalization winners deserve their success?

Elite anger destabilized democracy. Should we still live by merit?
or seek common good beyond merit?

1. WINNERS AND LOSERS___________________________________________________________
________________________________________________________________________________
Trump and Brexit was after decades old rising inequality.
Politician must address economic AND cultural grievances.

Populist discontent diagnosis:
  1. racial/ethnic/gender diversity -> cultural loss -> nativism/racism/misogyny
  2. globalization, technology -> economic loss -> anti-immigrants, anti-elites
  Loss is result of how elites and politicians governed.
  Elites are alarmed, do know that they failed.

Technology and globalization (cause of failure)
  1. Technocratic politics: achieve public good via markets
     Open/closed trade instead of right/left -> open/close-minded; global/tribal
  2. Public questions for experts only; beyond ability of citizens
  Reagan/Thatcher: government the problem, market the solution.
  Clinton promoted global trade and financial deregulation.
  Obama campaigned on morals but bailed banks and did not help home owners.
  fueled the right/left (Tea party/Occupy),
  Populism against elites - mostly center-left parties.

Opportunity rhetoric
  "you can make it if you try" no longer true; does not inspire.
  Inequality -> lower mobility.
  Health/education access -> higher mobility.

Meritocratic ethic
  Ethic: we do not deserve to be rewarded or held back based on factors beyond our
  control. Is (not) having talent on our control? Morality: OK to reward talented
  less working than less-talented hard word working?
  Potent politics: merit creates conceit winners and humiliation and resentment in
  loosers.
  Perfect meritocracy: no sense of gift, grace, sharing of common fate; a tyranny or
  unjust rule.

Humiliation politics
  Protest against humiliation: 1, resent winners 2. self-doubt
  Obama Clinton spoke of opportunity, Trump of winners/loosers.
  Brexit/Trump voters were the most with no college degree.
  Clinton's hubris: "I won places that are optimistic...."
  Trump on Paris agreement; "We don't want other countries laughing at us'"

Technocratic merit & moral judgment
  Confucius, Plato: meritorious & moral should govern.
  American founders hoped that knowledgeable/virtuous govern.
  Feared direct democracy/demagoguery.
  No morality in technocratic meritocracy - just GDP.
  Economists/market do not answer rising inequality, dignity of work,....
  Meritocratic elites from 1940 to 1980, won war, improved civil rights...
  After 1990, inequalities, deregulation, financial crisis, gerrymandering..
  Technocratic merit (elevate professionals and reduce others) -> angry politics

The populist uprising
  1958 "Rise of meritocracy"; level field for the poor (good) AND
  create hubris/humiliation and entitled/deserve-blame for winners/loosers (bad).
  Economy of: producers -> money managers.
  Experts technocrats make moral/political decisions; dis-empowered citizens.
  Need public discourse on meritocracy's effect on common life.


2. "GREAT BECAUSE GOOD"; MORAL HISTORY OF MERIT_________________________________
________________________________________________________________________________
Hire plumber dentist based on merit - efficient and fair.
How merit became toxic?

Why merit matters
  Affirms freedom - masters of our destiny; get what earned/deserve.
  Merit -> mastery/self-making/responsibility
  Responsible for morality AND fate/fortune/divine help(?)
  Is merit earned or a gift?

Cosmic meritocracy
  Fate reflects merit:
     theology (God); sin -> punishment, righteous -> bounty
       Genesis is about merit.
       Book of Job, God teaches humility;
       suffering is not about merit - about mystery.
     modern version (human will);  indolence -> poverty, wealth -> hard work

Salvation and self-help
  Salvation via good work (self-help) - God has to reward; is not omnipotent
     ''     an unearned gift - God omnipotent but allows evil & suffering
  Problem: God just/omnipotent and evil exists.
  Solution: free will - man responsible for evil; British monk Pelagius.
  St Augustine: if self-help for salvation -> pride, not humility
                only grace -> salvation
  Luther saw: rituals/good-works -> self-help (merit) -> salvation
         grace (anti-merit; helplessness)  -> salvation
  Problem: how can I be sure of grace?
  Solution (Calvin): God call people to a vocation -> work ethic -> salvation.
                     Work to glorify God, not for wealth.
                     Work is sign, not source, for salvation.
      Weber: work hard & consume little -> capitalism
             "For everyone God has prepared a calling, which he profess & labor"
      Work slid from sign of salvation to source (merit).
      Middle age monks, spiritual aristocracy, were closed in monastery.
      Calvin slammed the monastery behind.
      Hubris: the grace-elect saw sin from weakness.
      Work ethic: capitalism, self-help, meritocracy.

Providential thinking: then and now
  Merit was for salvation, now about economic success.
  Work-ethic was tense dialectic of merit and grace. Self-making ethic won the
  gratitude & humility.

2. "GREAT BECAUSE GOOD"; MORAL HISTORY OF MERIT_________________________________
________________________________________________________________________________

  Less faith in God, more self-made and less gratitude?
  No - 1. belief in self-made 2. belief in deserve success (moral).
  Weber: Fortunate not satisfied with fortune, need to believe: 1. they deserves it
  2. less fortunate deserve their due; THE TYRANNY OF MERIT
  Meritocracy is providentialism (Christian belief, God controls all events)
  without God.
  Jackson Lears: self-salvation -> Providence (protective care of God) approved inequality.
    American culture: uneven contest of ethics: 1. fortune 2. mastery.
    1. Eclclesiastes: "..riches not skillful...; time chance happen to them all"
    2. Covenant of grace -> works;  Catholic rituals -> Protestant moral strivings
       part of Providence (care provided by God)
    Self-help + providentialism = meritocracy rocket fuel
    Moral damage: "Culture of control.. secular version of providentialism;
    technocratic (economic) instead of religious" - see providence in inequality
    and world struggles (wars)
  Providentialism flavors: 1. hubristic 2. punitive
    1. 2008 Goldman Sachs CEO: big pay is result of "doing God's work"
    2. Hurricance Katrina: dretribution for Mardi Gras (sex perversion)
       Haitian earthquake killed 200K+: pack with devil/rebellion against France
       9/11: 40M abortions, pagans, feminists, gays, lesbians, ACLU; secular America.
       Japanes tsunami: we need it to wipe out egotism

Health and wealth
  Prosperity gospel (E W Kenyon)): God rewards faith with wealth and health.
     "I am blessed (wealthy/healthy)"
        "blessed": gratitude or deserved
     "Jesus died that we may live and abundant life"
      Individual responsible for for his fate - heal via prayer
      Gratifying when going well, demoralizing or punitive when going bad.
  Undo Obamacare - politician: higher cost for sick; sickness is sign of sin.
      Whole foods founder editorial: 70% of healthcare is preventable diseases
        (thru diet & exercise); the sick can blame themselves;  good health found
        in church of Whole food aisles.

Liberal providentialism
   Republican and democratic politicians: "America is great because it is good"
   (Quote claimed from Alexis Tocqueville's Democracy in America. it is from
    a 1941 religious book)
   manifest destiny to conquer and make the world safe and democratic.
   But moral countries are not wealthy, and wealthy/powerful are not just.

The right side of history
  Liberal's problem: "America is great because it is good" (salvation->goodness),
  implies that people are wealth because they are virtuous.
  Solution: accept meritocracy; welfare state criticism, personal responsibility.
      Welfare eligibility tied to personal responsibility.
  Liberal providentialism: defend policies as "the right side of history";
  not in Cold war but in Iraq war, Arab spring, Libya, Syria...
  argue from history before it happens.

The arc of moral universe
  Obama: "the arc of moral universe is long, but it bends toward justice";
  from King, from an abolitionist; a prophetic call against injustice
  -> providential faith for hope to powerless and hubris to powerful.
  Cold war victory -> free-market vindication -> neoliberalism -> globalization
  (right side of history) -> deregulation -> 2008 crisis.
  Liberal "right side of history": global capitalism AND health care, LGBT rights..
  Ray Charles 'America the beautiful': 'God (may?) shed his grace on thee.
  Oh yes hid did' - providential (Go controls all events) faith; merit drives
  out grace or recasts as something we deserve.

4. THE RHETORIC OF RISING_______________________________________________________
________________________________________________________________________________
  We view success the same way puritans viewed salvation - we earn it.
  Meritocrat: I deserve success from my hard (stressful) work.

Markets and merit
  Markets: 1. maximize welfare 2. people free to give value to good/services
  3. via equal opportunity, get what deserve (Reagan/Thatcher)
  Merit rhetorics 1. personal responsibility (reign in welfare)
                  2. rising (if work hard you will..)
  -> popular backlash against meritocracy

Rhetoric of responsibility
  Reagan: "We will never abandon those who, though no fault of their own,
           must have our help"; Coolidge/Hoover: 'no fault of their'
  Clinton: Opportunity responsibility go hand in hand & 'no fault of their own'
  British/German repeated  Opportunity/responsibility.
  Welfare state tracks responsibility; with bad behavior you are on your own.

As far as your talents will take you
  All politician used, was Obama's favorite; "no matter what you look like.."
  Equal opportunity -> talent -> hard work -> won success -> deserve rewards

Getting what you deserve
  "you deserve" in google ngrams has quadrupled since 1980
  Motivational tapes with subliminal messages - "I deserve to succeed"
  "luck egalitarian" philosophers - help victims of bad luck - not drug addicts...
  Politicians: "Want Britain to be the wold's great meritocracy"
               "People attracted to sports because it is a true meritocracy"
               "Want people to feel that can get ahead if they work for it"

Popular backlash
  Clinton's bad luck: rhetoric of rising became insulting; Trump never used it.
  Trump supporters resented elites, experts, and professional classes.
  For those on bottom, rising rhetoric was a taunt.
  Tyranny of merit: 1. with globalization & inequality, 'deserve what you get" is demoralizing
  2. requiring college degrees, demeans those without it
  3. insisting social/political problems solvable only by educated (conceited) experts
     disempowers non-expert citizens

Can you make it if you try?
  Most Americans believe in self mastery - majority of non-Americans do not.
  "Going from rags to riches" is more likely in China than in America.
  American overestimate rising, European underestimate it.
  Plato's "noble lie" is ευγενής ψεῦδος, but actually is γενναῖον εῦδος (brave lie):
            God created different people so that there is a guardian class.
  American dream myth: If on bottom, you can make it if you try.  (social harmony)

Seeing and believing
  See world via hope and fears; beliefs and convictions.
  Meritocratic hubris: via globalization, successful deserve success and non-successful
  can blame themselves.
  Merit from aspiration to fact; Obama: "..you can make it if you try ...
  I became president because of education...."
  Typical political rhetoric: hope -> fact -> hope ....
  If merit is fact/aspiration, those who fail can blame themselves/the system.


5. CREDENTIALISM: THE LAST ACCEPTABLE PREJUDICE_________________________________
________________________________________________________________________________
  Trump insisting Obama make his grades public: "I heard he was a terrible student"
  and threatened colleges if they made his grades public.

Weaponizing college credentials
  Trump's vocabulary was fourth grade.  Said that his uncle was MIT professor;
  he had smart genes.  He repeated that he was smart -> displayed the humiliation
  which meritocracy can inflict.
  Biden exaggerated his academic credentials - politicians feel that they have to.
  Supreme court nominee's reply to sexual misconduct: "I busted my tail in college"
  Globalization -> inequalities -> liberals wanted equality of opportunity

Education as the answer to inequality
  All politicians made education the solution to inequality and stagnant wages.
  Bush: "for every problem, solution starts with education"
  Clinton: "what you can earn depends on what you can learn"
  Obama: "you are competing with billions.. need good education"
  Liberals: globalism, as a fact of nature, came to stay; question how to adapt
  -> solution: education for minorities, woman, gays to compete in global economy.
  Solution is moral judgment by successful people - they say more education ->
  inequality is a failure of people not the system.
  Liberals "ignored monopolies, financialization, management" to confront no one.
  Education fixation: 1. blame those without a degree (2 out of 3)
                      2. promote credentializm  and prejudice against non-educated.

The best and the brightest
  Obama and Michelle "went through fair sorting went Ivy League and deserve status"
  2/3 of his cabinet were Ivy League, all but 3 had advanced degree -> not related
  to wisdom or instinct for common good; Wall-street friendly to 2008 crisis ->
  discredited Democratic party and paved way to Trump.
  Language of judgment and evaluation to persuade: 1. just/unjust 2. free/unfree
  3. progressive/reactionary 4. strong/weak 5. pen/closed NEW: 6. smart/dumb
  Smart phone... smart governing

The smart thing to do
  Bush used "digital age smart": smart cars and smart schools
  "not just the right thing but smart thing";
  Hilary Clinton: "use smart power...smart people.. the smartest I know"
  Obama: moral arguments for race, but "smart/dumb" on foreign policy & economics
         bonus: "smart" is bipartisan

Elites look down
  European and American surveys:
  disdain for poorly educated is more pronounced and accepted than other prejudices.
  Elites: 1. disparage 2. not enlightened or more tolerant 3. unembarrassed for prejudice
  Less educated internalize the elite view - they can only blame themselves.
  Relentless meritocracy -> acceptance of inequality.

Government by degree
  95%+ of congress are college graduates; credentialed minority governs uncredentialed majority.
  In 1960 75% had college degrees.
  British labor at 1979/2017 had 41/71% WO college degrees.
  PhDs in German government may resign because of plagiarism...
  Governing: not rocket science - requires practical wisdom & civic virtue.
  Best and brightest should govern is meritocratic hubris.
  Washington, Lincoln, Truman did not have a degree.
  Roosevelt's cabinet did not have advanced degrees.
  In US and Europe: worker parties -> educated elite parties.
  Rising rhetoric -> education -> dignified work -> fuel prejudice of non-educated
  -> non-representative democracy -> political backlash

Technocratic talk
  smart/dumb: technical; non-partisan - avoid political debate
  Obama, a technocrat: source of disagreement is lack of information
     "president has bully pulpit (wonderful church platform) for good information"
    Leadership: inform/convince, not moral persuasion - avoid partisan/ideological hassles
    People are decent but need professionals (with hubris) to sort info.
    Healthcare was about bending the cost curve, not decency.
    Market incentives for tech development, healthier nutrition,...
    Smart growth, regulation, entitlement, government,...(90 times)
  Technocratic defects: 1. empower/dis-empower elites/citizens
  2. eliminate discussion/politics

Technocracy versus democracy
  Technocrats and partisans both fail debating.
  About Brexit: "People had enough of experts"
  Oxymoron: "I believe in science"; Clinton & Obama

  But opinions direct perceptions/facts

Debating climate change
  Republican/democrats 57/27 with non-college, climate change exaggerated
                       74/15 with college, ....
  Similar for science courses instead of college - about politics not science.
  An informing technocrat glosses over morals/politics; how to:
  1. reduce fossil industry's influence 2. undo "throw away" consumer culture
  3. gain trust in government/experts
  Power/Morality/Authority/Trust.
  Face failures of 4o years or meritocracy & technocracy.

5. SUCCESS ETHICS_______________________________________________________________
________________________________________________________________________________
Meritocracy versus aristocracy
  Aristocracy/meritocracy: wealth inherited/earned+luck+support+teachers....
  Rich/poor prefer aristocracy/meritocracy for inheritance/opportunity
    ''        ''   meritocracy/aristocracy for self-pride/no self-blame

Meritocracy's dark side
  1958 "The Rise of Meritocracy" by Michael Young (sociologist, Labor party):
    passing aristocracy protected rich from self-regard,
    and poor from self-blame.  Rich could see wit, wisdom in poor equal to own.
    Poor knowing aristocracy was rigged could challenge it.
    Knowing morality of rank prevents winners/losers to believe in deserving.
    People classified by ability makes inequality wider; upper class not weakened
    by self-doubt; good education because they are gifted.
    "Elites trained in science inherit the earth".
    Meritocrats are "tactless as to unnecessarily offend non-elites";
    Clinton: "Trumpists are deplorables (deserve condemnation)"
    "First time in human history inferior man has no buttress for his self regard"
    Hubris + resentment = backlash
    Predicted 2034 less educated will rise against elites.

Meritocracy reconsidered
  People complain not about meritocracy but failure to live up to it;
  Professionals pass education to children; meritocracy is a myth is inheritance....
  But is ideal meritocracy flawed?
  1. is meritocracy just? - philosophers/public say no/yes
  2. does if give hubris/humiliation? - yes based on politics, what to do about it?

Would a perfect meritocracy be just?
  True equal access (family prevents it): perfect mobility: American & all democracies dream.
  1. freedom 2. hope that we get what we deserve
  Justifies inequality; no injustice if some run slow or fast.
  Is inequality morally just?

Do we deserve our talents?
  1. Talent is matter of luck; do we deserve winning the lottery?
  2. Society values and rewards talents
  Deserving talents is conceit.

Does effort may us worthy?
  Success: mixture of talent & effort
  Talent is embarrassing, effort is vindication;
  Olympic stories about hardships instead of feats.
  Meritocracy: 1. ignore moral arbitrariness of talent
               2. inflate  ''  significance of effort

Meritocracy Alternative 1: Market Liberalism (free-market)
  Economist-philosopher Hayek (1974 Nobel for how changing prices communicate
    information; inspired Thatcher):
    No government intervention for inequality
    No progressive taxation
    Welfare state is unethical
    Only freedom compatible equality is legal system.
    Careers open to everyone
    Government equal education programs are coercive
    No merit (deserving, moral...) - market outcome based on supply/demand.
    Hedge fund managers make more than teachers not because they deserve it.
    Equal start via government coercion is anti-freedom

Meritocracy Alternative 2: Welfare State Liberalism
  John Rawls, political philosopher, Theory of Justice 1971:
    Thought experiment "original position", veil of ignorance (Kant):
    select where you want to live if you did not know your social position.
    Pay/talent inequalities are morally arbitrary
    Difference principle: Winners run as fast  and share with losers;
    Natural talents are common asset.
    Effort depends on family and social circumstance
    Redistributive taxation
    Provides negative argument: earning not deserved
    No positive argument for: 1. winners being indebted 2. taxation
  Obama: "Your are not one your own - we-re on this together"
  No convincing argument for community/welfare liberalism

Rejecting Merit
  Hayek: Problem identifying merit - distribution justice based on moral merit
         instead of economic value leads to coercion (no freedom)
  Rawls: Income not based on merit but coincidence of talent/demand

Markets and merit
  Morally no difference of value and merit - winners/losers feel the same.
  Neoclassical economics: get what you deserve based on supply/demand.
  In perfect  competitive market, people morally deserve labor rewards.

Market value versus moral 0value
  Frank Knight 1920's:
    Productive contribution is little on non ethical measure of desert.
       Desert in philosophy: being deserving of something, whether good or bad.
    Having marketable talents is like inheritance - no morality.
    Want-satisfaction cannot be value because tastes/values change.
    We dispute (non-disputable) tastes - most troubling: want the "right" of wants.
    Teacher versus methamphetamine maker - illegal or not regardless of money
    drug maker cannot be more valuable.
    Casino-mogul/surgeon: gambling-desire/health values
    In perfect competitive market people do not morally deserve rewards.
    Price is not ethical value or human significance.
    No morality in economics.
    Value of satisfying demand depends on the morality of the ends it serves.

Deserving or entitled
  Source of hubris/resentment: entitlements bases on merit, virtue, or desert.
  Punishing thieves protects property and stigmatizes thieves;
  overtime stigmatizing gets blurred with non-merit.
  Education/money has honor/social esteem which is political.
  Aristotelian justice about public offices and honors not distribution of wealth.
  Now populist revolt is anger of non-educated against the educated elites.
  Insist on right over good makes esteem a matter of personal morality.
  Compensating the disadvantaged is patronizing them.
  "Racial/sexual injustice reduced ... left with the smart/dumb injustice"

Chance and choice
  Liberal "luck egalitarian": lucky to give to unlucky; merit defines unlucky.
  "Poor law thinking": determine if luck or poor choices; an immoral way to find
  what citizens owe one another; Problems:
  1. No based on compassion; failure to buy insurance is a bad choice?
  2. "Helpless victim" label - people present/perceive themselves as victims.
  Moral/civic cost of victim-hood: 1. Support disparaging 2. deny freedom & respect
  Start with rejecting merit, end supporting merit with vengeance.
  Brut luck (hit by meteor) vs option luck (gambler) -> meritocracy
  Not so clear: fire vs fire insurance.
  Insurance for lack of talent paid by those that have talent.
  Choice and responsibility reduces free-market/egalitarian friction.

Valorizing talent
  Egalitarians  try to fix smart/dumb inequality but valorizing the smart.
  Income inequality not due to genetic superiority of intelligence;
  due to talent/work-role preferences.
  Money success not related to smarts.
  Talent/money/smart all valorized(!)

Meritocracy's rise
  Blair 1996: "we are committed to meritocracy"
  Michael Young: "Is is hard in society that makes so much of merit to be judged as
                  having none.. no underclass has been left morally naked as that...
                  Meritocrats believe that success comes from merit and thus deserve
                  whatever they can get ... inequality becomes more grievous without
                  a bleat from the party that sought equality."
                  (other to stop using "merit", he had no solution)
  For center right & left rhetoric of rising language of moral progress & political
  improvement: "Those who work hard and play by rules (in global economy) will be
  able to rise as their talents will take them."
  Populist backlash was a surprise because the insult was not seen.

6. THE SORTING MACHINE__________________________________________________________
________________________________________________________________________________
  Merit -> wealth and esteem inequality -> resentment -> bad politics -> division
  Success defined in education and work.
  Colleges: sorting machines: 1. get mobility via merit 2. entrench privilege
            3. promote corrosive attitude for success
  Sorting machines not good for: 1. democracy 2. students 3. higher education

Conant's meritocratic coup d-état (stoke/blow of state)
  Before 1950's Harvard/Yale/Princeton for rich male Protestants, no exams;
  parties, sports, not studying -> wall street, law firms, research hospitals,...
  Closing the frontier ended opportunity (no land expansion -> mind expansion)
  1940's Conant chemist, Harvard president & in Manhattan project:
    * scholarship from Midwest public schools
    * SAT, based on army WWI IQ exam; 'for sorting the American population'
    * remake society based on merit;
    * individual freedom based on mobility (heart of argument)
       men develop capacities regardless of economic status
    schools will "recapture opportunity that was in the frontier"
    "industrial society must: assess abilities, develop talents, guide ambitions"
    High schools goals: 1st sorting, 2nd civic education; -> recruit merit elites
  Jefferson: wealth/birth aristocracy -> talent/virtue aristocracy
     Select genius youths in poor; nature scattered genius everywhere
     Free education in William and Mary college - not adopted
     Instead of "free opportunity and mobility", said: "natural aristocracy  will
     prevail over artificial aristocracy of wealth/birth".
     "Twenty of the best geniuses will be ranked from the rubbish annually and
     be instructed at the public's expense"

Intimations of the tyranny of merit (indirect subtle hint)
  Jefferson education: 1. Mobility legitimizes merit 2. Denigration of non-geniuses
  Conant's reply: 1. Goal in economic mobility from one generation to another
                  2. Sorting would not valorize/denigrate
  Actual results: 1. Less mobility - still have classes 2. more valorize/denigrate
  Conant opposed GI bill - country needs better students not more.

Conant's meritocratic legacy
  Harvard did not fully implement meritocracy, but now:
    * education: open poor, women, all ethnicities, with financial aid
    * academic merit via high school grades & SATs
    * argument for affirmative action regarding merit
    * college president rhetoric: excellence & opportunity go hand in hand
    * students praised for: excellence, diversity, talent, & effort

SAT scores track wealth
  SAT highly correlated to wealth, not scholastic aptitude or native intelligence
  For 200K income chances for SAT score >1400/1600 is 1/5, for 20K income 1/50
  SAT tutoring up 1,000/hour (?)
  College board insisted SAT not effected but tutoring, but added test to Khan academy
  higher/lower income make more/less use of this.
  Grades not SATs identify poor students likely to succeed in college.
  SATs are coachable via gimmicks & tricks

Meritocracy entrenches (diverse) inequality
  Gender, racial/ethnic diversity improved - half students identify as colored.
  Professionals help their children -> more students from economic top 1% then bottom 20%
  Harvard/Stanford all free for students with family income  <65K
  Children of working class are as likely for Harvard/Yale/Princeton as in 1954

Why elite colleges are not engines of mobility
  Average 2% of students rise from bottom to top - some colleges 10%
  more to consolidate privilege than mobility
  political rhetoric: more mobility more students
  "what you earn is what you learn": more insulting than inspiring
  For more mobility -> more thorough meritocracy (?)

Making meritocracy more fair
  Harvard admits 1/20 applicants 1/6 legacy applicants
  Duke admits donor applicants
  Williams college 30% are athletic applicants
  (Wealthy) athletics: squash, lacrosse, sailing, fencing ... horse back riding
  Fix: 1. drop SATs 2. drop wealthy privileges 3. class-based affirmative action
       4. government pull tax exempt unless half students are from lower classes
       5. stop the sorting because:
            1. resentment of those sorted out
            2. injury of those sorted in
            3. sorting diverts educating

Sorting and the allocation of social esteem
  Conant thought sorting will not create social esteem
  But superiority is part of earning and deserving
  1995 'Excellence' by John Gardner:
    1. "we have complex organizations .. need to search for talent"
       "great talent hunt" -> "rigorous sorting"
    2. talent demand worth the pain of education losers
    3. college - the only passport for meaningful life
    4. achievement is not human worth (?)
  Yale adopted need-blind admissions
  Before college was rubbing elbows with wealthiest now with smartest
  "Re-sorting of higher education" - colleges ranked by selectivity;
     gap of high and low selectivity colleges widened;
     student with high SAT seek high selectivity colleges.
     Majority of colleges accept those who apply.
     Yale in 1972 accepted 30%, now 5%
     University of Chicago 77% in 1993, 6% in 2019
     4% of students attend hyper-selective colleges that accept <20%
     Why high scoring students in few hyper-selective colleges:
       1. lower transportation 2. lower information cost - to compare SATs to others
       3. hyper-selective colleges are at the apex of meritocratic prestige
       4. employees believe the sorting that these colleges make

Wounded winners
  Re-sorting of higher edu. : 1. more inequality/wealthy students 2. damaged winners
  Success to get in viewed as individual/earned effort (merit hubris), but it
  is forged in pain - the soul-destroying demands of striving.
  High school years: stress, anxiety, sleep deprived, test, sport, dance, music..
  In Connecticut suburb 18% get disability diagnosis; 6x national average.
  Meritocratic arms race is unfair for: 1. for poor 2. children entangled.
  From 1976 to 2012 parents spent 5x more time to help children
  From 1981 to 1997 6-8 year-old playtime dropped 25% and homework doubled.
  "helicopter parenting" correlates with inequality;
   more in US and South Korea less in Japan, Sweden
  Wealthy teens: depressed anxious angry
    "The Price of Privilege": mental epidemic in wealthy teens;
    half of students binge drink abuse drugs
    1 in 5 had thought of suicide; rate  increased 36% from 2000 to 2017
    Why: "one path to happiness- money- which comes from attending prestigious college"
    Hoop jumping habit instead of think/explore who they are, what they like...
  Hidden epidemic of perfectionism:
    fragile self-worth contingent on achievement
    vulnerable to teacher, parent, & self judgment
    "Irrational ideals of perfect self have become have become desirable/necessary
    in a world where performance, status and image define a person's usefulness and value"
    "At time when young are sorted, sifted, and ranked by schools, colleges and workplaces,
    neoliberal meritocracy places strong need to strive, perform, and achieve at the center"
    one's merit=self-worth
  Harvard admissions' gap year in "Time Out or Burn Out for the Next Generation"

Still hoop-jumping
  Comping (competing for admission into student organizations)
  Harvard Crimson Key Society boasts 11.5 acceptance:
    "We do not want to put anyone in front of tourists"
    Less need for talent than need to re-enact the trauma and the rush:
    "You just through huge hoop to get to Harvard and want to jump through
     more to get the adrenaline going again"
  Colleges are training for competitive meritocracy; presidents/deans say
  "students learn more outside the classroom than in them" - networking
  Law school instructors were told not to tell students when grades will be posted
  because it causes too much anxiety.

Hubris and humiliation
  Need education reform to repair: 1. psyche of privileged 2.polarized civic life
  Sorting machine problems (tyrannies):
    1. for winners: anxiety, perfectionism, hubris, low self esteem
    2. for losers: demoralizing/humiliating sense of failure
    common moral source: "we are responsible for our fate" -> no solidarity
    to contend with rising inequality
  Complicit to income inequality and self-esteem: market-driven globalization,
  technocratic politics, oligarchic institutions.

A lottery of the qualified
  40K apply to 2K position in Harvard/Stanford; to reduce sorting 1. winnow out
  10K 2. set up a lottery for the remaining 30K.
  Treat merit as threshold not as maximum - best admission officers cannot truly maximize.
  Talent is complicated and less predictable; Brady as the 199th pick.
  Objections to lottery:
   1. academic quality - most likely not effected; do experiment admit half/half..
   2. diversity - give multiple tickets or admit qualified diverse then run lottery
   3. legacies & donor children - ideally eliminated or give 5-6 tickets for legacy
      and sell tickets for donors
   4. admission by lottery renders selectivity less meaningful and so erodes the
      prestige of the top colleges - good, or bad if "res-sorting" has truly
      improved teaching and learning
   This will benefit ~20% of students. For 80% in non-competitive or no college,
   the problem is work with little reward and social esteem.

Dismantling the sorting machine
  No easy because elite colleges are private. But can still do it:
  1. Leverage government financial and research funds.
     (Republicans imposed tax to some wealthy colleges)
  2. Fund public colleges, vocational schools, & job training
     Many state universities are in name only - funding dropped from ~50% to ~10%
     Student debt ($1.5 trillion in 2020) has soared.
  In 2014 $162 billion to universities, 1.1 billion on vocational training
    France, Sweden../USA spend 1%/0.1% GDP in "active labor market policies"
    Low funding due to: 1. belief that supply and demand will fix it
                        2. emphasis to higher education
  Higher education emphasis: 1. neglects/ disrespects other education 2. hurts economy

The hierarchy of esteem
  Learning plumbing should be respected to contribute to the common good (HOW?),
  not as consolation prize for low SATs or lack of money for Ivy league.
  Author: "Been teaching moral and political philosophy & believe that moral and civic
           education is important" - instead of this
          "value neutral science and specialized courses are more prominent"
  Technocratic emphasis -> failure of technocratic elites + poor public discourse
  Knights of Labor union demanded reading rooms in factories to read public affairs
  In 1800's: equality in independence and judgment - labor's contribution to general
             good was mind and muscle.
             Equality not for mobility but for intelligence and learning.
  Nurses & plumbers suited to art of democratic argument as much as management consultants.

Chastening merit's hubris
  Merit's (responsible and deserving) antidote -> indebted & lucky in success.
  Believing that we cannot control success in this or next world is hard ->
  thus merit drives out grace (as puritans also saw) sooner or later.
  Merit wins but is ungenerous to losers and oppressive to winners -> tyrant.
  Admissions lottery chasten merit's hubris.
  In 1960's seating in some schools, based on grades, would change after a quiz...
  To push back on merit, a teacher asked students to create their own T/F quiz.

7. RECOGNIZING WORK_____________________________________________________________
________________________________________________________________________________
  From 1945 to 1970's one without college degree could support a family.
  From 1979 to 2000's degree/non-degree pay change from 40% to 80%' ("the college premium")
    CEO pay 30x to 300x the average worker's.
    Productivity and GDP/capita increased 85% but non-degree real pay is less

Ending the dignity of work
  Meritocracy -> 1. economic hardship 2. work dignity erosion
  Money we make reflects our social contribution is embedded
  Globalization -> Inequality -> Resentment
  Most people without diplomas voted for trump.
  1971/2016 93%/80% of working men employed - 68% with only a high school education.
  Most of 20% stopped looking for work.

Deaths of despair
  "Despair deaths" (self-inflicted): suicide, drug overdose, alcoholic hepatitis
     Oxycontin dulled the pain (mostly construction workers)
     by 2014 more than from heart disease
     by 2016 more deaths per year than entire Vietnam war
                         per 2 weeks then Iraq/Afghanistan war of 18 years
     Not correlated with rising poverty
     2014-2017 life expectancy decreased
  Without a degree:
    1. 4x chances of dying than those with a degree
    2. less quality of life; level of pain, ill health, decline ability to work/socialize
    3. less family/community stability
  Michael Young vindicated: "No underclass has ever been left as morally naked"
  Gardner knew it: "those that saw the beauty of going ... as far as you can overlooked
                    the ones who can't...pain there is and MUST be"

Sources of resentment
  Trump did best in "despair death" and lack of degree regions.
  Pundits/politicians were surprised because they were oblivious/complicit
  Elite & progressives belittle working class whites:
    1. "trailer trash" - lower class whites
    2. "flyover states" - when traveling from coast to coast
                          1. West Virginia, 2. Kansas, 3. Mississippi
    3. "plumber's butt" - when bending over
    4. "deplorable" - deserve condemnation
    5. "cling to religion and guns"
  "To write off white class anger as racism is comfort food and dangerous"
  White laborers got low wages and a public/psychological wage:
    white privilege: parks, good schools, public functions..
    After civil rights, psychological wage subsidy fell away - not knowing
    that somebody is worse off.
  Liberals disgusted by lower-class white racism, but do see that attributing
    "white privilege" to working-class whites is galling (annoying/humiliating);
    they ignore struggle for honor for work skills that lower-class whites have.
  Wisconsin rural people think:too much tax money goes to undeserving people:
    1. minorities on welfare 2. professionals producing ideas
  Sociologist Arlie Hochschild embedded in Louisiana, conservative workers (bottom 90%):
    economic deprivation, cultural dislocation
    need government help but distrust it
    problem: automation, off-shoring, multinationals, and for white men competition
             for jobs, recognition, & government jobs increased
    Believed that they waited in line and blacks, women, immigrants, refugees
    were cutting ahead of them. Resented line cutters and complicit politicians.
    Elites called them racists, rednecks, "white trash".
    "You are a stranger in your land... struggle to feel seen ... no fault of yours
    ... in hidden ways you are slipping backward."
  Need work dignity in political agenda - no easy...
  "The ways that a society honors/rewards work is how it defines the common good"
  Common Good; Pope: “sum total of social conditions which allow people, either
                      as groups or as individuals, to reach their fulfillment
                      more fully and more easily.”
              Economists: sum of everyone's interests and preferences
  "What contributes to common good and what do we owe each other as citizens?"

Rewarding the dignity of work
  Conservatives: cut welfare, reduce food stamps to honor dignity of work
    Trump on 2017 tax: "dignity of work ...pride of paycheck"
  Liberals: raise minimum wage, health/child care, family leave.
    Working class whites fearing cultural displacement voted with "middle finger" -
    against their economic interests - more for fear of obsolescence.
    Robert Kennedy: "unemployment means having to be without use to one's fellow
                     citizens - to be the Invisible Man of Ralph Ellison"
    Talk of distributive instead on contributive justice
  Distributive justice balance maximizing GDP - from globalization distribute
  wealth to displaced workers via taxation.
  Since 1980's center-left in US and Europe: embrace globalization/prosperity to
     offset loss of local workers (losers). Problems:
     1. Never fully implemented - losers never retrained/compensated; due to
        oligarchic capture of democratic institutions
     2. Emphasis on GDP puts emphasis on consumption not production
        As consumers/producers we want cheap productions/satisfying work
        (balance this via politics)
  Globalization was for maximizing economic growth/consumers; no regard of the
  effect of outsourcing/immigration/financialization to producers (workers).
  Elites failed on the inequality and dignity of work.

Work as recognition
  Purchasing power, safety net (medicare, food stamps..) do nothing for anger/self-esteem
  Civic conception: Common Good is elevating and improving preferences
                not about summing preferences or maximizing consumer welfare.
  Role as producer more important than as consumer.
  Contribution value is moral/civic, not wages (demand/supply)
  Adam Smith: "consumption is the sole end of all production"
  John Keynes: " '' ... of all economic activity"
  Aristotle: ___"humans flourish through cultivation/exercise of abilities"___
  American republic tradition: agriculture, then artisans, then all labor
                               cultivate virtues for self-rule.
  1900's republic tradition -> consumerism, economic growth
  Martin Luther King: "society come to respect sanitation workers if it is to
                       survive.... all labor has dignity"
  Pope 1981 : "through work man ...become 'more a human being' increase
               common good with his compatriots"
  Catholic bishops ~1985: "people contribute to society in ways that respect
                           their freedom and dignity of their labor"
  Axel Honneth, philosopher: wealth distribution is about recognition/esteem
  Hegel: labor market is system of recognition, markets do not provide skills
         or recognition; trade associations could do that

Contributive Justice
  Economic growth/consumerism appeals to pluralists societies with disagreements;
  spares contentious moral/controversial debates.
  Disagreements of meaning of: 1. life 2. human flourishing 3. preferences/desires
  Maximizing consumer welfare is neutral; agree to maximize the economic pie
  than to shrink it.
  Contributive Justice is not neutral on best way to live; contribute to common
    and earn the esteem of fellow citizens.
  Fundamental need is to be needed by those who we share life.
  Robert Kennedy: "Fellowship, community do not come from consuming together..
  come from dignified employment and good pay... I helped built this country"
  Progressives 'rising' rhetoric:  "go to college", "compete in global economy",
                    "what you earn is what you learn", "make it if you try"
                  -> flatter winners & insult losers

Debating the dignity of work
  Uncomfortable question: Do market outcomes reflect the true social value of
  people contribution to common good?
  We confuse money we make with value we make; from meritocratic hope that
  we get what we are due; from Old Testament to "right side of history".
  Material success as as sign of moral desert is a temptation.
  Debate would not produce agreement but would:1. disrupt complacencies
  2. moralize public discourse 3. move beyond polarized politics

The Hubris of "Open Agenda"
  Owen Cass, political advisor, 'The Once and Future Worker' 2019: On grievances
    tapped and failed to resolve: enable workers to find jobs that pay well to
    support  strong families and communities - matters more than economic growth.
    1. Wage subsidy (anti payroll tax) for low paying jobs.
      Denmark, Netherlands covered 75% to 90% of wages during pandemic.
      (US gave unemployment insurance; people lost jobs)
    2. Scale back environmental regulations in manufacturing/minig
    3. Restrict trade, outsourcing, and immigration
    Globalization is not right or left, but "open or closed";
    the college grads, winners, are "open" and critics are "closed" / bigots
    "It is hard to imagine a more condescending way of defending neoliberal
     globalization to those it leaves behind."
    The "open" propose for better education, more opportunity...
    "If the economy no longer works for average worker, it is he who needs to
     transform into something it likes better."
    "Open" is not sustainable where majority is left behind... question is not
     whether the "open" will lose but rather to what.


Finance, Speculation, and the Common Good
  2008 finance crisis; debate 1. terms of taxpayer bailout 2. Wall Street reforms
  3. (mush less) how finance remade the economy and transformed "merit/success".
  Trade & immigration more attention than finance in populist backlash.
  Finance industry is large in advanced economies; % of GDP tripled since 1950's.
  In 2008 it had 30% of corporate profits.
  Less on real investments/productivity and more on profits via complex finances.
  Adair Turner: "little evidence that finance last 20-30 years has increased
    growth/stability...possible that it extracts rent (windfalls) from economy"
    (Windfall gain: an unexpected; from lottery, inheritance, or supply shortage.)
    translation: 1990's deregulation did more harm than good.
    In US/UK 15% of financial go into productive companies.
  Michael Lewis 'Flashboys': fiber link between Chicago and New York increased
    high speed trading by few milliseconds - worth hundreds of millions (?)
  Credit default swaps (lender afraid of default on a loan used CDS to swap risk)
    bet on future prices of bonds - one wins the other loses - like casino.
  Companies use profits to buy back shares instead of investing.
  James Tobin economist: "casino aspect of financial markets... throwing cream
     of our youth...remote from production"
  Finance -> moral & political flaw of reward/value -> prestige/mockery ->
    traders/producers.
    Politics of recognizing work: eliminate payroll taxes, tax consumption,
      wealth & financial transactions.
  Taxation: raising revenue and express society's judgment of what is valuable.

Makers and Takers
  'Sin taxes': tobacco, alcohol, casinos; deemed harmful by society.
  Proposals for sugar and carbon are similar - extend this to finance.
  Warren Buffet was on a lower tax rate than his secretary;
    capital gains taxes lower than income taxes.
    Lower taxes for investors increased GDP or investors are "job creators"
    and deserve to be rewarded (merit based)
  Paul Ryan, devotee of Ayn Rand (Russian Laissez-faire philosopher):
   makers/takers: economy contributers/receivers of more benefits than pay taxes
   concerned of more takers than makers
   Accoring to Turner and Buffet, primary takers are financiers;
     more finance is slowing economic growth.
   Constitutive justice problem: who is maker/taker.
     one solution: reduce/increase payroll/finance taxes
   What kinds of work are worthy of recognition? <--> What do we owe each other
     as citizens?  To answer these nee robust community - believe
     "we are all in this together"
   Problem: less reliance on fellow citizens, and less grateful for their work
     cause: global supply chains, capital flows, cosmopolitan identities
   Problem: No sense of indebtedness
     cause: meritocratic sorting; believing that we deserve success
   Problem: No dignity of work
     solution: repair social bonds
   Symptom of problems: political upheaval

CONCLUSION: MERIT AND THE COMMON GOOD___________________________________________
________________________________________________________________________________
  Henry Aaron:
    His father surrendered his place in line to whites.
    Jackie Robinson inspired him to practice playing baseball with
    a stick and bottle caps.
    Broke Babe Ruth's record.
      His biographer: "hitting was first meritocracy in his life"
      Wrong conclusion: with equal chance everyone could rise to far as their
                        talent will take them.
      Right conclusion: eliminate racism that can only be escaped by hitting
                        more home runs.

Beyond equality of opportunity
  Instead or repair conditions that people want to flee, we have politics to
  repair inequality via mobility.
  Equality is at best partial ideal - happiness is not just freedom to rise,
  but able to live in dignity and culture whether or not you rise.
  James Truslow Adams 'The epic of America': coined term "the American dream";
    "dream is not just cars, high wages, but of social order... each person
    attain fullest stature and be recognized by others for what they are
    regardless of birth or position"; example Library of Congress: " young old
  Beyond equality of opportunity
  poor rich black white executive laborer reading"

Democracy and Humility
  Public spaces that gather people across class, race, ethnicity, & faith are few.
    We live, work, shop, play, go to school at different places.
    When sorting machine has done its work, winners and losers believe that they
    deserve their lot.
    This gives poisonous politics - cannot listen to one another or reason about
    public questions.
  Merit was that we can via work/faith bend God's grace to our favor.
    Secular version is about freedom - we can make it if we try.
  Democratic obligations: 1. consumerist 2. civic;
    If common good is:
      1. maximizing consumer welfare, then
           fate of democracy does not depend on moral bonds of citizens.
      2. worthy purpose/ends via political discussion, then
           meet in public spaces and abide our differences
  Believing that you deserve the wealth that you get make solidarity impossible.
  Why do we anything to the poor?
    answer: we are not self made or self sufficient;
            finding our talents are worthy is good fortune not our due
  A sense of our contingency of our lot to inspire humility:
    "There, but for the grace of God, or the accident of birth, or mystery
     of fate, go I"
     To turn back from the harsh ethic of success that drives us apart.
     Current tyranny -> less rancorous, more generous public life
